jvizcarra13	@MariaCespedesc @PCaterianoB @pcmperu Well madam, if in 30 years they haven&#39;t learned anything ... in nine months they won&#39;t either. Never did fanaticism come to fruition.

CarbajalCruzado	@MariaCespedesc @PCaterianoB @pcmperu I do not agree with their thoughts about mining, knowing that they do not give a large percentage of the GDP of Peru, agriculture also gives business but not as much as mining, here the bad thing is that the governments regional governments do not know how to audit or manage these assets	Cuestion-de-confianza	3	2020-08-06 04:01:54	1291222945805881345	1291040818095169536
