Cuestion-de-confianza	5	1	FrepapBancada	2020-08-05 22:08:05	The Frepap bench expresses its rejection of the discriminatory statements of the citizen Pedro Cateriano. Nin‚Ä¶ https://t.co/Nrm6DJwegp		
Cuestion-de-confianza	5	2	gvilner	2020-08-06 13:48:03	@FrepapBancada However, not giving confidence to the Cabinet showed that they only supported individual interests and did not think about the country. Needless to say of other POPULIST decisions so far in this Congress.		1

Cuestion-de-confianza	5	4	SamuelSalasPe	2020-08-06 13:13:26	@FrepapBancada Please! Don&#39;t be the victims now. They cannot deny the obvious: they are easy to play pieces in the political game.		1
Cuestion-de-confianza	5	5	CALSOVA	2020-08-06 13:09:48	@FrepapBancada What use is the statement? Did they think of the national interest in a sui generis conjuncture? The country is not governed by groups or parties. It is a whole and the national interest prevails. The parts are resolved after the general. They have already failed.		1
Cuestion-de-confianza	5	6	glorialuzuriag1	2020-08-06 11:22:13	@FrepapBancada @meiermq Pedro Cateriano is an extremist fanatic of the great groups of economic power and his bible is the Constitution of 1993 and also expresses an absolute contempt for the life, health and economy of the Peruvian people and their authentic political representatives		1
Cuestion-de-confianza	5	7	JC96162681	2020-08-06 11:05:35	@FrepapBancada @meiermq Very good, the üêü has done what thousands of Peruvians wanted. The wolf &quot;Cateriano&quot; disguised as a sheep tried to deceive us.		1
Cuestion-de-confianza	5	8	RonaldHidalgoS	2020-08-06 08:18:18	@FrepapBancada Getting victimized doesn&#39;t help. @MerinoDeLama asks @MartinVizcarraC to choose ministers with the right experience; however it does not evaluate congressmen. I see that only Martha Ch√°vez knows what to do. That she uses it to cover up her circle is another matter. The Frepap only has fans		1
Cuestion-de-confianza	5	9	omar051277	2020-08-06 07:57:37	@FrepapBancada You will change the presence of the congress and remove that ugly image that it had for decades .... We just need to support us #SueltaMiPlataMalditaAFP # PL5674 https://t.co/31w7dZ4lmN		1
Cuestion-de-confianza	5	10	MarioLeonGZ	2020-08-06 05:28:15	@FrepapBancada I listened to your spokesperson and I congratulate you for your intervention. I confirm that they are a true bench and that they work with and for the People. Parasitic politicians and ballast journalists say otherwise. The true people are with YOU and keep working. Regards.		1

Cuestion-de-confianza	5	17	rosacadillo30	2020-08-06 03:59:01	@FrepapBancada @fkrklect We congratulate the congressmen for first thinking about their people and their NEEDS, especially today that we are going through hunger and misery and Vizcarra only thinks that he is in power by acting and lying himself corrupt and dictator, he only thinks about himself		1
Cuestion-de-confianza	5	18	Wiliam79068696	2020-08-06 03:50:30	@FrepapBancada @OsedaYucra The political mafias, the cartels of unlicensed universities and those that are still in the process of regularization, plus the interests of the great business class, are the main reasons for not approving the confidence of the cabinet.		1
Cuestion-de-confianza	5	19	luach12	2020-08-06 03:49:42	@FrepapBancada Do you want to talk about discrimination? And do not come to say that they have already apologized to the community because Juan Ataucusi&#39;s &quot;apologies&quot; were pathetic ... like the election of his party. https://t.co/AtmAqNNW8H	20	14

Cuestion-de-confianza	5	24	cot_roger	2020-08-06 02:12:24	@FrepapBancada I am a Catholic, I have friends who are evangelicals and people who, like all Peruvians, must be respected, regardless of beliefs, undervalued as Mr. Cateriano has erroneously done. You continue your work of inspection and demanding the best for Peru.		1

Cuestion-de-confianza	5	27	LuisSuasal	2020-08-06 01:53:24	@FrepapBancada Do not mix the religious with the political, criticism is political and if you are in politics you have to put up with everyone&#39;s political opinions, I described them as political sheep, they have been misguided by taking Fujimoristas and that now takes their toll forget to come back		1
Cuestion-de-confianza	5	28	mixel2011	2020-08-06 01:52:26	@FrepapBancada Before Mr. Cateriano&#39;s statements, I made them aware of his political ignorance and lack of judgment in this pandemic, which is equal to a war, that unfortunately more Peruvians are going to die üòî		1
Cuestion-de-confianza	5	29	SAYSAYSAYSA	2020-08-06 01:36:10	@FrepapBancada I don&#39;t know what the victims are. You can see their bad intention, the fanaticism left them at the time of voting, they are tail sheep from #LosInjertosdelaPlazaBolivar		1

Cuestion-de-confianza	5	31	RudolArt	2020-08-06 01:18:33	@FrepapBancada when they approved the immunity mamaracho, it was believed that they were caught by ignorant politicians. But with this action you can see that they are now other otorongos		1

Cuestion-de-confianza	5	35	RocoAramburu1	2020-08-06 00:17:21	@FrepapBancada Agree on which authorities work on the word to action, but Congress denied confidence to the Cabinet. They didn&#39;t let them start! Consequence: In the State many things are paralyzed xq ministers have to be changed. Meanwhile, the pandemic continues. Those minutes count TODAY !!		1
