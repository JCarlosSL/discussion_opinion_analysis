irvin_cd	@MariaCespedesc @PCaterianoB María Teresa, faced with the crisis that Peruvians are experiencing today, Mining is one of our LIFEGUARDS for the economy.

MarcoCo60265063	@MariaCespedesc @PCaterianoB Cateriano contradicts himself, he tells you that they have no public experience that is why they do not understand what he is talking about, but when he chose his nephew&#39;s friend as Minister of Labor he indicated that that experience was not necessary but that he entered learn ..
