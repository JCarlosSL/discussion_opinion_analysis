abortion_as_rights_or_choices,409192893_1100030352001,1,IHAWKER,Fri 11 June 2010 02:46 AM," Bill includes amendment to allow abortions at overseas bases   WASHINGTON   A Senate provision to allow abortions at overseas military bases could set up an election year fight between abortion rights supporters and conservative lawmakers who have thwarted the measure for years.  Senate Republicans threatened to block the full defense authorization bill when it comes up for a vote later this month after the abortion provision was attached in the chamber s Armed Services Committee mark-up.  Under the amendment, female servicemembers and military dependents stationed overseas would have access to abortions, provided they pay for the procedure themselves and medical personnel on base are willing to perform it. No military doctors would be required to perform abortions if they object to the practice.  In a statement, amendment sponsor Sen. Roland Burris, D-Ill., framed the issue as one of basic fairness for the tens of thousands of female troops and family members stationed outside the United States.   It is critical that we provide the highest quality care for our service members while they are serving our nation overseas, and that includes allowing women and their families the right to choose at facilities operated under the Department of Defense,  he said.  Under current law, physicians at overseas bases can perform abortions only when the mother s life is in danger, or in cases of rape or incest. In the latter two, women still must pay for the procedure themselves.  In recent years, similar proposals to allow overseas abortions have been offered in the House and Senate as part of the annual budget bills, but failed before they could become law. The issue was not broached in the House this year, and House Armed Services Committee Chairman Ike Skelton, D-Mo., restated his public opposition to a change in the policy.  The American Civil Liberties Union and NARAL Pro-Choice America both backed Burris  plan. In a statement earlier this month, Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., called the abortion amendment  a moral failure of this Congress  and promised to fight to remove the provision.   Since the mid-1990s, attempts to change this law have been rejected repeatedly,  he said.  Regardless of their views on whether abortion is ever justified, the vast majority of Americans agree that taxpayer dollars should not subsidize such controversial procedures.   Both the House and Senate versions of the defense authorization bill already include repeal language for the military s  don t ask, don t tell  law, a controversial move that Republicans in both chambers predicted could jeopardize passage of the final bill. Twenty-six House Democrats voted against the  don t ask, don t tell  provision, but the full measure passed by a 229-186 margin.  The Senate is expected to vote later this month on the authorization bill, which includes the abortion provision, and a conference committee will work on differences between the House and Senate versions throughout the summer.

Our mothers worked together in the school cafeteria.   Her two older sisters were the same age as my two older brothers.  The families were good friends.   We have not seen each other in sixty  years.  Now she lives in Tenseness about two miles from our youngest daughter and family.     But, the one thing that is locked in both of our memories from first grade is the day we were told that her 14 year old sister, Margret   died.    Margret died because she was pregnant and her mother tried to abort the baby with a coat hanger or some other such method.  What a horrible way for anyone to die.  We all believed that it was incest.  There were never any charges against her mother.  It was just the way things were done in those days.      Yes, we had a home for unwed mothers,  The Florence Crittenton Home.   But, the shame that families felt in those days was enormous and almost unbearable.      I m unashamedly  prolife  - I believe that life begins at conception.  In Margret s case we lost both the young mother and the unborn baby.   I m confident that everyone wishes there would never be another abortion.  But, we can not go back to the days of the  coat hanger abortions.    Personal notes:  We are thankful that we could not have gotten an abortion in 1971 while stationed in Kinzening Germany. I think we what have jumped at the opportunity.  My wife was not well and it was a tough permanency.  But, we would have missed having one of the greatest young men God very created, our youngest Timothy Robert John Love now 38. He has been married for 16 years to a wonderful wife and they have two terrific young children, our Caleb and Abbey.   Also our oldest granddaughter most likely would have been aborted if it was possible.  She is the apple of her mom and dad and grandparent eyes.    To paraphrase Patrick Henry, I say, I know not what others may choose but, as for me, give me a country where abortions of any type is not necessary or wanted.  Until then lets may it a last, but a very safe choice of the mother.   I just don t know how to make a no abortion  deportation  rule work. "

I just realized, I posted the original draft of this just after midnight last night.  Sometime, I do strange things in my sleep. Oh well, pick and choose from each of them or ignore both of them.                Service members and their families should ever be denied a government entitlement that is available to general population.      We all have different views on this topic for many different reasons. I would like to share the following, all true;  Last week, I reconnected with Mary  , through a classmates forum, a lady who was in first grade with me, way back in 1943.  Our mothers worked together in the school cafeteria.   Her two older sisters were the same age as my two older brothers.  The families were good friends.   We have not seen or spoke or talked with each other in sixty  years.  Now she lives in Tenseness about two miles from our youngest daughter and family.     But, the one thing that is locked in both of our memories from first grade is the day we were told that her 14 year old sister, Margret died.    Margret died because she was pregnant and her mother tried to abort the baby with a coat hanger or some other such method.  What a horrible way for anyone to die.  We all believed that it was incest.  There were never any charges against her mother or anyone else.  It was just the way things were done in those days.      Yes, we had a home for unwed mothers,  The Florence Crittenton Home.   But, the shame that families felt in those days was enormous and almost unbearable.      I m unashamedly  prolife  - I believe that life begins at conception.  In Margret s case both the young mother and the unborn baby were lost.     Personal notes:  My grandmother, a very small Pima Indian, died giving birth to my mother and her twin brother.  The doctor said, she was too small to give birth to twins.  That was 1896 and there was no such thing as a safe abortion.  The stories we ve been told about how the my grandmother death impacted my grandmother, I m confident that he would, if it were possible, chosen my grandmother s life over the life of the twins.  As soon as my mother discovered she was pregnant with me, she was advised to have an abortion.  I would be her seventh child.  My father had just been confined the in Florida insane asylum.  My next older sibling was very not in good health.  The family vas  dirt poor  and I would be another mouth to feed.  My mother would not even consider it   I m sure in part her decision was based on the circumstances of her own birth.   I m thankful for the life that my mother gave me.   We are thankful that we could not have gotten an abortion in 1971 while stationed in Kitzingen Germany. I think we what have jumped at the opportunity.  We didn t want anymore children.  My wife was not well and it was a tough permanency.  If she/we would have had the abortion, we would have missed having one of the greatest young men God very created, our youngest son Timothy now 38. He has been married for 16 years to a wonderful a terrific young lady.  They are parents of two loving wonderful children, our Caleb and our Abbey.   After Tim s birth, I visited the doctor and had  the procedure.   As a father and husband, if given the option of choosing the life of my wife over the life of our unborn child, I would always choose my wife.  My final thoughts: Abortion should never be a substitute for birth control and this horrible  partial birth abortion  procedure is in MN2BHO, nothing but infanticide.     The statement by my much loved friend,      an individual woman&apos;s right to choose what is done to HER body    has to be given a lot of weight.  But, prostitution is outlawed in most states as is drug use, and these both affect a persons use and control over their own body.    Finally, I don t know how to reduce the astronomical number abortion. I m confident that everyone wishes there would never be another abortion.  But, we can not and must not, go back to the days of the  coat hanger abortions.  The answer might be education, education, education.   "

Mind you I was not an angel as a teenager, but I was a virgin until I was 23.  Likely I would still be a virgin today if me and this one ol gal hadn&apos;t gotten completely blitzed and found ourselves in a compromising position the next morning.  Now that being said.  Parents, talk to your kids about sex, drugs, and all those other uncomfortable subjects.  Kids and young military personell, don&apos;t do it, if you do, use protection, I don&apos;t care if you are male, female, both, or neither, use protection.  It is cheaper than an abortion, and frankly, folks like me would like to see abortions used safely and very rarely, and I don&apos;t want to hear about some young servicemember getting killed at an abortion clinic by some whacko either.  Should service members have access to abortions over seas?  Absolutely, IMHO they should as sometimes they are needed, say the health/life of the mother, rape, ect.  I do not feel they should be available as an alternative form of birth control or because a woman doesn&apos;t want to wear the maternity uniform.  Also, doctors should have an opt out for such things as well.  I want my doctor to wholeheartedly be in favor of any operation he is doing on me and I want him to have the experience and knowledge as well.  I wouldn&apos;t want a brain surgeon operating on me that is against using certain techniques on moral grounds to be the one doing the operation where that method is required, would you?

What I have in mind are child-bearing questions other than a woman s right to choose whether or not to have an abortion, either on demand or with some restrictions.   Does a woman have the right to choose the sex of the baby she carries? The color of the baby s eyes and hair? To have triplets? . . . What voice does her partner   husband or otherwise   have in her decision? Does a woman have the right to choose to have a baby against her husband s wishes?   Natallie was diagnosed with ovarian cancer  .  Before doctors removed both her ovaries, she and her partner, Howard, had six embryos fertilized with his sperm. The embryos were then frozen and stored.  The couple broke up. Howard withdrew his consent for the embryos to be used and asked that they be destroyed.  Natallie wanted to implant the embryos and sued to be allowed to do so without his permission.   She has argued he had already consented to their creation, storage and use, and should not be allowed to change his mind.  Current [national] laws require both the man and woman to give consent, and allow either party to withdraw that consent up to the point where the embryos are implanted.  Her lawyers argue that the right to a family life is enshrined in [an international] Convention of Human Rights and that she should be allowed to implant the embryos.   How would you rule? If national and international laws weren t involved, would you feel different? "

Another point along this line is that parents are not teaching their kids properly also about sex and preventative measures from teen pregnancies.  Still, I believe in birth control, and have even known several men who have had vasectomies to prevent more children, and women who have had their tubes tied.  The point is, people of this day and age are quite aware of STD&apos;s &amp; VD&apos;s, plus AIDS.  Yet, they are too stupid to use the 2 brain cells in their head to have thought better and end up with a child that they did not want.  Instead of thinking with the big head on the shoulders, men are thinking with the small head in their pants, and girls/women should have the brains enough to also prevent it also.  To me, they are just as guilty as the men are.  But, my belief in &apos;Pro-Choice&apos; is that they made the choice to not use protection and were stupid enough to get pregnant.

What I have in mind are child-bearing questions other than a woman s right to choose whether or not to have an abortion, either on demand or with some restrictions.   Does a woman have the right to choose the sex of the baby she carries? The color of the baby s eyes and hair? To have triplets? . . . What voice does her partner   husband or otherwise   have in her decision? Does a woman have the right to choose to have a baby against her husband s wishes?   Natallie was diagnosed with ovarian cancer  .  Before doctors removed both her ovaries, she and her partner, Howard, had six embryos fertilized with his sperm. The embryos were then frozen and stored.  The couple broke up. Howard withdrew his consent for the embryos to be used and asked that they be destroyed.  Natallie wanted to implant the embryos and sued to be allowed to do so without his permission.   She has argued he had already consented to their creation, storage and use, and should not be allowed to change his mind.  Current [national] laws require both the man and woman to give consent, and allow either party to withdraw that consent up to the point where the embryos are implanted.  Her lawyers argue that the right to a family life is enshrined in [an international] Convention of Human Rights and that she should be allowed to implant the embryos.   How would you rule? If national and international laws weren t involved, would you feel different?&quot;</u>   Good questions Mach!  My personal belief ONLY - &amp;quot;Only a woman ever really knows who the father is.&amp;quot;  Words I heard when I was very little and over which much ado has been made in popular culture over the subsequent 50 years.  How many babies are born without benefit of a dad in the picture - for example, a one night stand that definitively altered a woman&apos;s life and opportunities because she chose life over the convenience of an abortion?  Should a sperm donor have a right to abort baby because he doesn&apos;t like where his sperm has been donated?  In this case the couple broke up - but the &amp;quot;dad&amp;quot; was still nothing more than an unknown sperm donor to an unknown egg.  She should be allowed to be implanted with the fertilized in vitros and the extent of the donor&apos;s parental rights should be to have a certificate not name him as father but rather reflect the unknown identity of the donor.  Just like any other sperm donor, he should have the right to forever relinquish claim on the child as his own - financially and legally.    Just my humble opinions, Mach.  Very good ethical questions."

But let me pose some questions. Some believe that abortion is the death of a human being. There is no qualifications being expressed - Abortions kills a human being.  So.  1. If abortion consists of taking a human life, no different than taking any other human life, would it be proper then to inflict either the death penalty or life in prison (depending on whether you believe in Capital punishment)?  It would seem to automatically follow. So I ask this for those who believe abortion is murder.   Second: Most of those who want punishment for abortion, advocate little or no punishment for the woman, but harsh penalties for the abortionist. Does this make sense? The woman after all is the one who looked for, hired, and paid the &amp;quot;hit man,&amp;quot; who is more of an &amp;quot;accessory to the crime&amp;quot; then the Mr. Big, i.e., the woman who hired him.  It would seem to me, that even those who say that a fetus is a full fledged human being, in practice do NOT see the fetus as a full fledged human being.  If the fetus is such a human, why then are the proposed penalties, almost nothing for the woman, and even for the practicing abortionist, only five years. Is this not a contradiction? If a human being is a human being - Why the shilly shallying attitude?  Third. If a fetus is a full fledged human being, why are there many people who recogise an &amp;quot;exception&amp;quot; if the life of the woman is in danger. Is there any other legal situation in which we allow ourselves to choose which individual lives and which dies?   So once again it would seem to me that those who see the fetus as a full fledged human, are sort of hedging their bets.   Finally, while the point has been made that there is a difference between a fetus and a sperm or an egg, is there a Moral difference? Is birth control which prevents an egg being fertislised ok, different from birth control that eliminates a fertislised egg? I ask this because the second example is &amp;quot;abortion&amp;quot; in the moral sense of the word.  To sum up, it seems to me, that we are drawing lines in the sand, always a risky proposition. Would it not be best to draw that line, after the birth of the fetus, and declare that birth to be the moment of legal transformation?  I say this because in my opinion, birth control is morally just as much an abortion as the medical procedure.   Dave "

I have always heard discussion on this issue, and it was always a decision between the father, mother, and doctor, but it was usually because of a health risk to the child or mother. If it was an unwanted pregnancy, a family member somewhere usually raised it, or it was put up for adoption.

It is the life of a prescious, prescious child, and men should be held just as accountable. It should be considered a dishonor to &amp;quot;knock someone up&amp;quot;, instead of a great feat of accomplishment. Anyone can do that.  This is not an unrealistic venture providing it be kept in the civilian sector with little government involvement...just community, churches, volunteers, donations, etc. Waivers would have to be signed, of course for liability purposes, and if the woman choose not to go along with the program then find their own means.

So once again it would seem to me that those who see the fetus as a full fledged human, are sort of hedging their bets.   Finally, while the point has been made that there is a difference between a fetus and a sperm or an egg, is there a Moral difference? Is birth control which prevents an egg being fertislised ok, different from birth control that eliminates a fertislised egg? I ask this because the second example is &amp;quot;abortion&amp;quot; in the moral sense of the word.  To sum up, it seems to me, that we are drawing lines in the sand, always a risky proposition. Would it not be best to draw that line, after the birth of the fetus, and declare that birth to be the moment of legal transformation?  I say this because in my opinion, birth control is morally just as much an abortion as the medical procedure.   Dave&quot;</u>  The idea is killing one instance and murder in another.  Killing is seen as moral or legal taking of a life as in self-defense, execution because of a crime committed, or national defense.  Murder on the other hand is the unlawful or immoral taking of life.  An aborted child comes most often as the result of a woman who had consensual sex with no intent of having and keeping a child.  The situation of getting pregnant is avoidable in these cases but a priority of sexual gratification is made over the life of the resulting child.  In the case of an execution someone has forfeited their own life (not another&apos;s) by their actions.  They are guilty where in the previous scenario, the executee is not.  You say &amp;quot;Most of those who want punishment for abortion, advocate little or no punishment for the woman, but harsh penalties for the abortionist.&amp;quot;  To be honest, I&apos;ve never met a person who&apos;s advocated that.  Those I know who oppose abortion merely want the procedure to be illegal for all or some abortions.  The only time an abortionist would be &amp;quot;punished&amp;quot; fpr an abortion is if they knowingly performed an illegal abortion.  You ask about choosing who lives and who dies in a legal situation.  And the answer is a simple yes.  A police officer has the right to kill a person who is threatening the life of another and is in the position to make it happen.  You also ask the difference between egg, sperm, and fetus.  An egg alone cannot produce a human.  A sperm alone cannot produce a human.  A fertilized egg is the most basic stage of human life.  To answer the follow up question about birth control that prevents a fertilized egg from taking hold and the birth control that prevents an egg from being fertilized, there is an obvious difference.  The easiest answer that solves all the problems except the supposed need that a person just has to have sex is that one abstain.  I see one form of BC as particularly reprehensible because as you state it is a form of abortion.  It&apos;s easy to say wait for the birth to be the point a person is declared human but it ignores all kinds of biology in doing so. "

Sex between consenting adults is not, has not and never will be illegal. You disapprove of abortion. I get that. But you are not going to force anyone to have a child they don&apos;t want...unless you are willing to bear all the costs associated with that child. Abstinence is a great theory. It&apos;s never going to happen. Why??? Inherent biological traits for reproduction. Our bodies practically force us to copulate. Making the personal choice of whether or not having a child is the right thing is not our right to legislate. As for your little parable...well you forgot about the wife and three kids that guy was supporting. Not quite the same a fetus that is or isn&apos;t fully developed into a human."

After all, condemns fail, some birth control pills are actually refurbished gummy bears made in China, and as we always say, &amp;quot;Schit happens.&amp;quot;  Can a mass of undifferentiated cells be declared a human being with all the rights guaranteed? And if this is true, what is the moral difference in one mass of cells and another?     Is it not true that the fertilised egg has about as much chance of developing into a human being as the egg alone, if it wasn&apos;t for the human being who is carrying them? Would it not be fair to say that the decision to carry that fetus should be the decision of that human being?    quote:  Originally posted by Silverbusa: It&apos;s easy to say wait for the birth to be the point a person is declared human but it ignores all kinds of biology in doing so.&quot;</u>   I agree. I would like a cut and dried, unequivocal answer that is not messed up with moral questions or when this cell or that becomes a human being.   So for example the Catholic Church seeks this unequivocal answer by saying that birth control IS the moral equivalent of abortion. Others set the boundry later, and others set the boundry even later then that.  But I agree with the logic, if not the conclusions of the Catholic Chruch. To prevent the fertilisation of an egg that would be otherwise fertilised is moraly the same as a full fledged abortion.   If I create a situation that leads to a death, legally I am considered culpable, and if not charged with murder itself, I can be charged with &amp;quot;Man Slaughter,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Negiligent Homicide.&amp;quot;  I solve this delemma by declaring that Birth itself is the moral line in the sand.   But while I respect your opinion, you are not actually acting on your opinion. If aborting a fetus is indeed Murder, why then are you not advocating the penalties we normally assign to killers? And to add insult to injury, the one who is really responsible gets off free, while we reserve whatever penalties to the &amp;quot;accessory&amp;quot; to the crime.  Dave   I bumped this post of mine, because I STILL don&apos;t see anyone advocating life in prison, or the death penalty for abortion.

I know that if I were raped and a child was the consequence of it, there&apos;s no way that I would want to carry around a daily reminder of such a vicious attack for 9 months. There&apos;s just no way to regulate this that would appease everyone that has an opinion about it, because then you get into gray areas, like, well what if it&apos;s going to harm the mother...or the baby has birth defects that are known early in the pregancy?....You can&apos;t just sit a woman down in an abortion clinic and ask prior to the procedure...&amp;quot;well, how did this happen? were you being irresponsible and end up knocked up? yes? ok, then you can&apos;t have an abortion.&amp;quot; Personally, I think that abortion is too easy an out for irresponsible behavior, I also don&apos;t think that the choice should be taken away.

Sex education should be mandatory, and should begin in grade school; by second grade.  Sex offenders should also be sterilized and segregated from society.  No second chances, and no parole.

One of the things we have discovered about using computers to define the real world is that binary is wholly inadequate.  This lead to the whole field of &amp;quot;fuzzy logic&amp;quot;, which essentially is programming in that gray space between 0 and 1.  Black and white are almost never the only choices.  In this case, the &amp;quot;humanity&amp;quot; of the prospective baby, as well as the &amp;quot;morality&amp;quot; of the abortion decision, are both on sliding scales.  As some have noted, there are at least instances of medical need under which abortion makes sense - this at least shows some part of the curve.  In my opinion on the case of abortion, there are two big questions, which must be addressed in order.  The first question is this: When does a couple of cells become a human being?  The churches say &amp;quot;at conception&amp;quot;, with which I argue both because of the lack of real criteria and because of the surprising number of fertilized eggs that do not make it.  At the other extreme are those who think the answer is &amp;quot;at birth&amp;quot; which is abhorrent in my opinion.  The answer must lie somewhere in between, but until we have established testable criteria we can never really agree on a point.  I would personally entertain the 2nd trimester - at the beginning I would not call it a human being, by the end I would say definitely it is.  In fuzzy logic, this would be a two-term output membership function - we would need to agree on the shape, perhaps trapezoidal but more likely sigmoid.  The second question is what factors should be considered in abortions - rape, poverty, health, convenience?  What is the societal cost of allowing/forbidding the abortion?  What is the moral cost?  All of these are to be considered, and none of them are black and white.  Again, to add my own 2 cents here, I feel that a significant number of abortions are making the best of a bad situation.  The output MF would look similar as the previous, but the big issue would be determining the input MF&apos;s. "

And what criminal punishment should be given to the father of the fetus, or the parents or family members of the woman/girl getting the abortion, who drive her to the doctor? If abortion is murder, under civil and criminal law, should they not be punished as &amp;quot;accessories before and after the fact&amp;quot;?  It is all very easy to say that &amp;quot;abortion is immoral and should be against the law&amp;quot; - but no law is worth anything more than a bucket of spit unless there is a civil or criminal punishment for breaking it.

All the other industrialized democracies have faced problems like ours, yet they&apos;ve found ways to cover everybody -- and still spend far less than we do.  I&apos;ve traveled the world from Oslo to Osaka to see how other developed democracies provide health care. Instead of dismissing these models as &amp;quot;socialist,&amp;quot; we could adapt their solutions to fix our problems. To do that, we first have to dispel a few myths about health care abroad:   1. It&apos;s all socialized medicine out there.   Not so. Some countries, such as Britain, New Zealand and Cuba, do provide health care in government hospitals, with the government paying the bills. Others -- for instance, Canada and Taiwan -- rely on private-sector providers, paid for by government-run insurance. But many wealthy countries -- including Germany, the Netherlands, Japan and Switzerland -- provide universal coverage using private doctors, private hospitals and private insurance plans.  In some ways, health care is less &amp;quot;socialized&amp;quot; overseas than in the United States. Almost all Americans sign up for government insurance (Medicare) at age 65. In Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands, seniors stick with private insurance plans for life. Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs is one of the planet&apos;s purest examples of government-run health care.   2. Overseas, care is rationed through limited choices or long lines.   Generally, no. Germans can sign up for any of the nation&apos;s 200 private health insurance plans -- a broader choice than any American has. If a German doesn&apos;t like her insurance company, she can switch to another, with no increase in premium. The Swiss, too, can choose any insurance plan in the country.  In France and Japan, you don&apos;t get a choice of insurance provider; you have to use the one designated for your company or your industry. But patients can go to any doctor, any hospital, any traditional healer. There are no U.S.-style limits such as &amp;quot;in-network&amp;quot; lists of doctors or &amp;quot;pre-authorization&amp;quot; for surgery. You pick any doctor, you get treatment -- and insurance has to pay.  Canadians have their choice of providers. In Austria and Germany, if a doctor diagnoses a person as &amp;quot;stressed,&amp;quot; medical insurance pays for weekends at a health spa.  As for those notorious waiting lists, some countries are indeed plagued by them. Canada makes patients wait weeks or months for nonemergency care, as a way to keep costs down. But studies by the Commonwealth Fund and others report that many nations -- Germany, Britain, Austria -- outperform the United States on measures such as waiting times for appointments and for elective surgeries.  In Japan, waiting times are so short that most patients don&apos;t bother to make an appointment. One Thursday morning in Tokyo, I called the prestigious orthopedic clinic at Keio University Hospital to schedule a consultation about my aching shoulder. &amp;quot;Why don&apos;t you just drop by?&amp;quot; the receptionist said. That same afternoon, I was in the surgeon&apos;s office. Dr. Nakamichi recommended an operation. &amp;quot;When could we do it?&amp;quot; I asked. The doctor checked his computer and said, &amp;quot;Tomorrow would be pretty difficult. Perhaps some day next week?&amp;quot;   3. Foreign health-care systems are inefficient, bloated bureaucracies.   Much less so than here. It may seem to Americans that U.S.-style free enterprise -- private-sector, for-profit health insurance -- is naturally the most cost-effective way to pay for health care. But in fact, all the other payment systems are more efficient than ours.  U.S. health insurance companies have the highest administrative costs in the world; they spend roughly 20 cents of every dollar for nonmedical costs, such as paperwork, reviewing claims and marketing. France&apos;s health insurance industry, in contrast, covers everybody and spends about 4 percent on administration. Canada&apos;s universal insurance system, run by government bureaucrats, spends 6 percent on administration. In Taiwan, a leaner version of the Canadian model has administrative costs of 1.5 percent; one year, this figure ballooned to 2 percent, and the opposition parties savaged the government for wasting money.  The world champion at controlling medical costs is Japan, even though its aging population is a profligate consumer of medical care. On average, the Japanese go to the doctor 15 times a year, three times the U.S. rate. They have twice as many MRI scans and X-rays. Quality is high; life expectancy and recovery rates for major diseases are better than in the United States. And yet Japan spends about  3,400 per person annually on health care; the United States spends more than  7,000.   4. Cost controls stifle innovation.   False. The United States is home to groundbreaking medical research, but so are other countries with much lower cost structures. Any American who&apos;s had a hip or knee replacement is standing on French innovation. Deep-brain stimulation to treat depression is a Canadian breakthrough. Many of the wonder drugs promoted endlessly on American television, including Viagra, come from British, Swiss or Japanese labs.  Overseas, strict cost controls actually drive innovation. In the United States, an MRI scan of the neck region costs about  1,500. In Japan, the identical scan costs  98. Under the pressure of cost controls, Japanese researchers found ways to perform the same diagnostic technique for one-fifteenth the American price. (And Japanese labs still make a profit.)   5. Health insurance has to be cruel.   Not really. American health insurance companies routinely reject applicants with a &amp;quot;preexisting condition&amp;quot; -- precisely the people most likely to need the insurers&apos; service. They employ armies of adjusters to deny claims. If a customer is hit by a truck and faces big medical bills, the insurer&apos;s &amp;quot;rescission department&amp;quot; digs through the records looking for grounds to cancel the policy, often while the victim is still in the hospital. The companies say they have to do this stuff to survive in a tough business.  Foreign health insurance companies, in contrast, must accept all applicants, and they can&apos;t cancel as long as you pay your premiums. The plans are required to pay any claim submitted by a doctor or hospital (or health spa), usually within tight time limits. The big Swiss insurer Groupe Mutuel promises to pay all claims within five days. &amp;quot;Our customers love it,&amp;quot; the group&apos;s chief executive told me. The corollary is that everyone is mandated to buy insurance, to give the plans an adequate pool of rate-payers.  The key difference is that foreign health insurance plans exist only to pay people&apos;s medical bills, not to make a profit.  The United States is the only developed country that lets insurance companies profit from basic health coverage.   In many ways, foreign health-care models are not really &amp;quot;foreign&amp;quot; to America, because our crazy-quilt health-care system uses elements of all of them. For Native Americans or veterans, we&apos;re Britain: The government provides health care, funding it through general taxes, and patients get no bills. For people who get insurance through their jobs, we&apos;re Germany: Premiums are split between workers and employers, and private insurance plans pay private doctors and hospitals. For people over 65, we&apos;re Canada: Everyone pays premiums for an insurance plan run by the government, and the public plan pays private doctors and hospitals according to a set fee schedule. And for the tens of millions without insurance coverage, we&apos;re Burundi or Burma: In the world&apos;s poor nations, sick people pay out of pocket for medical care; those who can&apos;t pay stay sick or die.  This fragmentation is another reason that we spend more than anybody else and still leave millions without coverage. All the other developed countries have settled on one model for health-care delivery and finance; we&apos;ve blended them all into a costly, confusing bureaucratic mess.  Which, in turn, punctures the most persistent myth of all: that America has &amp;quot;the finest health care&amp;quot; in the world. We don&apos;t. In terms of results, almost all advanced countries have better national health statistics than the United States does. In terms of finance, we force 700,000 Americans into bankruptcy each year because of medical bills. In France, the number of medical bankruptcies is zero. Britain: zero. Japan: zero. Germany: zero.    http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/21/AR2009082101778.html "

Tort Reform - adds  30B to the costs of healthcare. 2.  Dry up as much of the fraud as possible. Estimated to be  50-75B per year. 3.

This has been tried in two states and failed. In my state we had in effect Universal Medicaid called TENNCARE. It was such a success that we had out of staters moving to Tennessee for the benefits. In a short period the state nearly went broke. Now it is still available, but somewhat limited (rationed?). By the way, we have a Democrat Gov. who I voted for. In Hawaii, the Universal Healthcare lasted seven months. In that case, the employers discontinued coverage of their employees and in other cases the employees dropped the insurance for the nearly free healthcare. I admire Finland and their policies and customs, but until the United States stops being the Police force, and the welfare source for the world we can not achieve the comfort you have.  Back to the Healthcare, doctors spend over seven years of hard labor to practice medicine. In addition, hundreds of thousands of dollars for equipment and education. Even with public support for the colleges. The use hospitals with the most advanced diagnostic equipment in the world. The saying, &amp;quot;You get what you pay for&amp;quot; is true. Due to current government intervention, rates for services to Medicare, Medicaid, and TRICARE are severely reduced to the physicians. In many cases, doctors can not afford to take new patients in these programs. My wife and I were dropped by one physicians group because we had TRICARE from the military. These programs already have limitations, but not to the extreme of the HR3200 bill. When health providers agree to accept these programs, they agree to give the beneficiaries the lowest rates. Guess what this does to those who need coverage that don&apos;t have insurance? The rates must be at those prior to the discounts of the government programs. So indirectly, the government is creating the situation they claim they are trying to fix.  By the way, your command of the English language really impresses me."

The issue is that the public option will operate on a 5  or so overhead versus the 30  for private insurance companies.  That is based on current overhead for Medicare and major insurers.  So they have a 25  advantage.  In order to fix this they have to reduce the cost of doing business like senior executive salaries.  Look at Unitedhealth for an example.

Frankly, I&apos;ve just watched a lot of American movies as a kid and then started reading books in English - I&apos;ve never really learned the grammar (although my accent and spelling is more &amp;quot;British&amp;quot; due to school) and rely on what sounds and looks right. (You can actually notice that European countries that &amp;quot;dub&amp;quot; movies with their language instead, usually don&apos;t speak English that well, for example Spaniards and Italians.)  I do have to agree that a lot of us smaller countries get a free ride due to US military power, although I don&apos;t agree that military spending is an obstacle in the way of better health care and education.  I don&apos;t have knowledge of past US attempts at public health care providers, but the balance between private and public providers is quite interesting to me because of our system (for example competition that makes private providers lean toward better service and shorter waiting times - and cooperation where public health centres use private care providers, and private providers can refer you to a public specialist or hospital). In the coming years I see us moving toward more private providers due to the aging population creating more demand for faster service (currently the demand isn&apos;t great enough for more private providers).  The solution you will find might not of course have a public option at all. They key here is, in my opinion, to find the most suitable proven system and improve on that. For example the Swiss or perhaps Japanese system might be more suitable for the US.   It&apos;s also about having reform simultaneosly on all fronts, for example (concerning your Hawaiian example) we have mandatory occupational health care (at the employer&apos;s expense) in addition to NHI, and treatment from private providers is also reimbursed to an extent (I think 40-60  for treatment and drugs). Private care high techonology usage is also subsidised in a way due to the reimbursements, and high technology equipment is also developed with public and private cooperation (although from what I understand US public funding for medical R&amp;D is very high too), to the extent that we export quite a lot of medical equipment. Higher education is also free, so the financial burden isn&apos;t as great for newly graduated doctors and nurses - this does &amp;quot;backfire&amp;quot; to an extent when some move abroad after better wages, but it seems to be working ok for now. These (and probably a host of other things like the composition of public health centres and private medical centres) together make the system work, not just one aspect.

This would be somewhat punitive and may drive &amp;quot;superior&amp;quot; people to another venue. When in the civilian telecommunications industry, in sales, when we made a big sale it was a windfall and the top management denied the payment. Yet they took full advantage of the sales. This is true of all segments of our business and it is not going to change soon. All in all, industry can not compete with taxpayer funded health insurance.

Now we have a decent framework for a discussion, and I understand how you felt the article was relevant.  Any substantive health care reform has to go beyond the pieces of legislation currently in front of Congress.  The Senate&apos;s version of the bill tacitly admits that Medicare costs will rise under it by holding Louisiana and Missouri harmless from those rising costs, having the other 48 states reimburse them for their Medicare cost increases.  Yet every time a Republican mentions that tort reform and malpractice insurance reform measures need to be addressed as part of a holistic approach to the problem, they are pooh-poohed by the folks on the left side of the aisle.  Entitlement programs such as Medicare have been politically taboo from substantive reforms since I was a child back in the 70&apos;s.  None of the politicians (from either side of the aisle) since then have wanted to show true leadership by proposing such substantive reforms, as it is truly career suicide for them to do so.  Instead, they cut a couple thousand here and a couple thousand there from the &amp;quot;discretionary&amp;quot; budget, which never is enough to compensate for the growth on the entitlement side of the budget.  The problem with that is that entitlement programs are already more than half of the budget, and as your article projects they will exceed 3/4 of the budget within the next decade. "

When we dropped the atom bombs, we did not measure its effect only on the direct result of the blast itself but included the long-term effects of the fallout, the residual radiation, loss of vegetation, the loss of the family lines, the loss of infrastructure, the generations-later effects on the grandchildren, etc. Why do you insist on ignoring the collateral savings of insurance premiums, the lower costs of consumables, the costs to the communities themselves in tax dollars who have to offset losses of hospital/facility, providers, the effects on the patients who lose out because their provider is suddenly not available, the providers who remain who have to take on more patients to see to the coverage of the community, cost of fuel by patients who have to travel further for treatment, etc.  I don&apos;t care about the analyses you may have read. None of them I have ever seen consider the dollar amount of the impact on the individual communities, some of which go bankrupt as a result of covering tort suits where the community itself is responsible. And I only named a few issues off the top of my head. There is much more. If you look at the community level effects, you can surely expand that to also be a global effect.  Yes, tort reform is a start. And it is a significant start. Stop awarding millions to those who suffer a broken toe when it could happen to anyone. "

The public knows the status quo is unsustainable and they want fundamental change now.     In the new CBS/New York Times survey 66 percent worry that they will lose their coverage, 75 percent worry that their health care costs will go up and 80 percent worry that more Americans will become uninsured if we don t pass reform.   In the same survey,  82 percent say that our health care system needs fundamental changes  (33 percent say the system needs to be completely rebuilt and 49 percent say it needs fundamental changes)   In the new Time Magazine survey  69 percent say it is important (with 46 percent saying very important) to pass major health care reform  in the next few months   versus just 28 percent who say it its not.    Voters don t trust the Republicans on the issue at all and trust Obama and the Democrats far more.     By more than 2-to-1 (55 to 26 percent) respondents in the CBS/New York Times survey say  Obama has better ideas  about how to change health care than Republicans.   The new bipartisan GWU Battleground survey showed President Obama and Democrats in general with identical 21-point leads over Republicans on who would better handle health care reform.   Most important, when voters get more information about the likely elements of the final plan, they like it.     In the new NBC/Wall Street Journal survey,  when people are read a description of the plan that includes higher taxes on wealthier Americans, they favor it by a 56 to 38 percent margin.  This level of support is steady from June and April.   In both the Time Magazine survey and the new Pew Research Center survey,  strong majorities (in some cases up to 80 percent) support elements of like an employer and individual mandate, the public option, insurance reform and an income surtax on wealthy Americans.    In a survey that Greenberg Quinlan Rosner conducted for NPR in conjunction with the Republican firm Public Opinion Strategies, a Democratic message in favor of reform beat a Republican message (written by POS), by a 51 to 42 percent margin.   The major difficulty for progressives, to this point, has been that it is hard to make the strongest positive case for reform because a unified bill has not emerged from Congress. Instead, all voters are hearing are stories about how much the plan will cost (on top of the stimulus, budget and bailouts), that it will be paid for with high taxes and that Democrats are bickering and divided. Meanwhile, the attacks on reform coming from Republicans and their allies are much simpler and easier for votes to digest, especially when Republicans can train their fire on unpopular specifics that will not likely be in the actual bill.  All of this suggests that  when Democrats can finally coalesce around a single plan and Obama can go out and forcefully sell it, support is likely to increase significantly and Obama and supporters of reform will be able to get more traction in their arguments.

Many are turning to teleconferences and the internet for discussions with their  constituents  instead of having to deal with shout down mobs.   They could always take a page from the Bush administration too and just rope off the protesters.   Why not an ID check at the door so that actual constituents get seats and those that were bussed in just to disrupt can sit in the bleachers?  I also like this from the HuffPo:  Four Creative Ways to Deal with Right-Wing Rent-a-Mobs   1. Get Up In Their Grills: Don&apos;t just sit quietly and let these congenital know-nothings take over meetings and try to rattle our Congressional reps. Fortunately, as the Huffington Post&apos;s Sam Stein reports, many unions are gearing up to do just that -- to directly engage these wingnut Tea Party alums at town-hall meetings. Good on them.  2.Boo Who? Air America&apos;s thoughtful Thom Hartmann has this suggestion:  &amp;quot;Start the meetings by introducing someone who&apos;s terminally ill and who has been rejected for health insurance or who has had treatment denied.&amp;quot; Let&apos;s see the Astroturf crowd boo someone in a wheelchair with a breathing tube. (Come to think of it, these morons just might just do that. But it, um, looks bad on TV).  OK, two more ideas that are even more telegenic and media-driven:  3. Sign Language Print up big signs for each meeting reading &amp;quot;I&apos;M WITH STUPID.&amp;quot; Also draw a big arrow on each, and every time one of these loudmouths (they&apos;re often wearing ball caps or carrying Bibles) stands up and starts ranting, just stand next to him/her and hold up the sign. Makes a good photo and great &amp;quot;B-roll&amp;quot; for TV!  Finally, arguably the most effective and creative idea. Since we&apos;re getting involvement from the working class (union members), how about the theatrical/creative community helping out with this tactic:  4. Men in White: Have two guys dress in white, loony-bin attendant coats. Then, provide them with a large butterfly net (easily built by a local theatre&apos;s prop department.)  Then, each time an Astroturfer starts ranting, have these two guys throw the butterfly net over the ranter and gently guide them out the door.  Now that&apos;s the kind of funny footage even Fox News might use, albeit grudgingly."

The left talks about intimadation tactics yet get physical?  You can find all this at WFLA970.com There are video and audio. REAL PEOPLE were  ed. There was no right wing oraganization there causing this to happen. I hope you people out there are happy, I can see violence ready to break out on both sides.   Pathetic.&quot;</u>   Truly so.  These organized bully boys are part of Obama&apos;s civilian army that we asked about last summer.  The Moneychanger buys them from the downtown D.C. office.  It&apos;s the southside Chi-Town way of doing business.  Reason and rationality and sense of duty to respond to taxpayers is NOT their way--only intimidation.  Scumbags, they are.  We can readily see why the bully boys so despise common citizens&apos; God-given and Constitutionally affirmed right to keep and bear arms. "

Jackson s legacy is to decline to engage in an argument with him that begins and ends with race.   source: (url at the start of the thread)  Representative Davis is the only member of the Congressional Black Caucus to vote against passage of the House healthcare bill.

The latest Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey finds that 51  oppose the plan. And as has been the case for months, the emotion s on the sign of the naysayers: 40  Strongly Oppose the plan, while just 23  Strongly favor it.  Support for the president s health care plan fell to 38 , its lowest ever, just before Thanksgiving. Followed by two weeks at 41 , this marks the lowest extended period of support for the plan yet. With the exception of a few days following nationally televised presidential appeals for the legislation, the number of voters opposed to the plan has always exceeded the number who favor it.  &apos;This suggests that public opinion about the health care plan is hardening,&apos; says Scott Rasmussen, president of Rasmussen Reports. &apos;Despite the fact that most American believe our health care system needs major changes, most are opposed to what Congress is currently doing about it.&amp;quot;  source: &amp;gt;http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/current_events/healthcare/september_2009/health_care_reform&amp;lt;   Most Democrats agree with what their elected officials are doing in this area; some polling suggests a 76  approval rate on the left. However, it appears that Rasmussen and other pollsters are reporting an  overall  approval rating for the Democrat reforms in the range of 38  to 42 .   This, IMHO, is why Democrat leaders are behind closed doors. It is exactly what any party facing a political crisis would do. The left may have enough votes to win the Congressional battle; but the political &amp;quot;war,&amp;quot; reelection etc., may be looking harder and harder to win.  TT "

Each of the 50 sataes have 2 elected senators and all of them should be part of the creation of any bill in congress. They represent the interests of their respective states. By the exclusion of those senators it also excludes their state from having a say in the plan.  ONE CAN ONLY SEND A MESSAGE TO THEM IN OUR NEXT ELECTION

People are quick to point out how many hundreds of billions of dollars in profits a health insurance company makes, but people fail to recognize this in perspective of revenues and expenses. Profit margin is a measure of this ratio.  Wellpoint (Blue Cross Blue Shield) 3.83  Humana 3.13  United HealthCare 4.2   It appears the median profit margin is around 4  for health insurance companies.  Then I pulled up two large defense contractors that get 90  of their business from the US Government. The important thing to note is that these contracts run almost exclusively on &amp;quot;cost-plus&amp;quot; contracts, arranged such that they are guaranteed a fixed profit on the contract. The payment they receive is the &amp;quot;cost plus&amp;quot; a pre-defined industry standard profit margin. It doesn&apos;t matter whether the contract is worth  100M or  100k, the contractor gets X .  Raytheon 7.7  General Dynamics - 7.5   It appears that the government thinks its OK to give defense contractors a profit margin that is almost double that of health insurance companies. The government is the only buyer from these contractors and has a lot of power. If the government believed a 4  profit margin would be &amp;quot;fair&amp;quot; they would require the cost-plus contract be given according to those terms. Clearly the government believes 4  is half as much profit as a company deserves to make in profits&amp;quot;.    thought this migtht be helpful in your debate..   "

We can even agree that to an extent, Insurance companies are also part of the problem although we will not agree on why that is.  But one thing is clear, their rising costs are the result of their rising costs which go back to the providers themselves which is part of a viscous circle that i do not wish to go through yet again.  Sobering fact:  liability insurance is the single largest cost for medical providers due to the amount of lawsuits for mostly frivolous cases. One cant go a day without hearing or seeing a commercial for some lawyer wanting to sue anyone for anything. Passing a tort reform bill would save 25  quickly in medical costs.  Currently there is little competition in the health care industry, much of that due to government restriction which is why companies should be allowed to sell and compete nationwide.  The way our health care is delivered though insurance companies needs to be changed to a more competitive and market based system.  Doctors such as general practitioners, surgeons and other providers would then lower prices and attract consumers based upon a price vs. performance(experience) criteria like the way people chose other services and products.  Insurance companies would need to adapt by analyzing trends and developing their services accordingly.  People should be able to buy a policy they configure themselves instead of coverage mandated by the state.  Insurance companies should not be in the business of setting prices for the services that medical providers give their patients.  I dont understand why people cant pay for an office visit out of their own pocket like they do for a tune up on their car or furnace. With competition and market forces a typical office visit would be 50  less than what it is now.  If we want to cover those who truly cant afford health insurance it should be done with government subsidizing premiums from private carriers and not by taking control of 1/6th of the economy.  But lets be clear on this,  Offering coverage to just the 20 million legal citizens who genuinely cant afford health coverage is still going to cost around 400 billion over 10 years.  Thats not cheap but it certainly beats the 2.4 trillion this mess they are considering now.  4.4  profit isnt very much by any stretch. I make an easy 20  as a small business and many good, high volume McDonald&apos;s franchises make over 9   Does a CEO making 24 million per year seem a bit much?

AS for the immigration problem. Again you just don&apos;t get it. I DONT BELIEVE IN ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION you dolt. What I&apos;m saying is that illegal immigration happens because the system is broken and difficult to go through. Even if you are a HIGHLY DECORATED AMERICAN CITIZEN THAT HAS SERVIDED HIS COUNTRY AND MARRIED A FOREIGN BORN CITIZEN and have had AMERICAN children with their foriegn born spouse has difficulty going through this process all the time. The delay is not because of improved security and background checks WHICH I SUPPORT it is because the bureacratic system that is not up to date causes uneccessary delays and fails on some occaisions to stop the CRIMINALS &amp; TERROIST from LEGALLY entering this country. If a government worker was not processing your SSA check in time for you because they are claiming that they are verifying that you actually should be getting a check and it takes a year or two after your retirement.

I do understand the 2nd amendment and freedom of speech doesn&apos;t mean freedom to speak any language you feel like speaking. Why can&apos;t you understand the spoken language here in America is English, and if you live here, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s asking that much to speak the language. Like I said, if I moved to Mexico, they aren&apos;t going to bend over backwards to accomidate my English language. I would have to learn Spanish to properly assimilate into their society. Do you know what the word ASSIMILATE means? People shouldn&apos;t move to this country and then expect the country to change to accomidate their native language.  I agree our immigration system is broken, but what ever they do to fix it shouldn&apos;t include allowing foreign nationals to become U.S. citizens, or to even get temporary visas without knowing the complete background of these people. This country has enough bad people here, we don&apos;t need more of them.  And just for clarification, it isn&apos;t the fault of the U.S. government that many Mexicans are sperated from their families. They CHOOSE to be separated from their families by choosing to come here and leave their families behind. If they don&apos;t like being separated from their families, then they shouldn&apos;t come here if they can&apos;t bring their families with them. Maybe they should stay there and fix the problems with their own country instead of bringing them here.   Lastly, Obama&apos;s not my buddy. I didn&apos;t vote for him, and I believe it&apos;s very possible he&apos;s nothing more than the corrupt poilitition the state of IL is so infamous for.

It&apos;s First Amendment not Second. Your Right.  It&apos;s funny though that it took a few people to post here before anyone caught on to it.  See this is an emotional issue that causes people to write things without paying attention to what they say or the fact they qoute.  But the fact of the matter is that Private business can print it&apos;s material in any language they like because of Freedom of Speech. They may conduct their business anyway they like regardless of your feelings on the subject. You may not agree with it but that is the fact of life. Even if we get English to be made the official language of this country, which I whole heartily support, it will only affect Government Business not the store down the street from you.  There are many states that print material in all sorts of languages and it is a waste of money. It does not encourage any assimulation into this country. Grampi46 I know what the   it means to assimilate gut again you fail to read that I AGREE everyone who lives in this country needs to learn to speak and understand the language. I&apos;ll even give you an example of something I did that upset the administration at the school district I use to teach at when I was a teacher. I was put into a classroom of spanish and vietnamese speaking kids. My spanish sucks and I don&apos;t speak a lick of vietnamese. I did not agree with having to teach them all their classes with Spanish books so I threw them out and gave them all English books. The teachers went Ape Sh t over it and complained. Fortunately for those kids the Principal let me continue to do it my way. At the end of the year my students scored higher in their English proficiency test then the other ESL classes. I proved to a bunch of white liberal jack asses that their theory of teaching was wrong. Last summer I ran into three of these students since I still live in the neighborhood that I use to teach in. Two have completed their masters degrees and the other is now a police officer. They told me that what I did for them was the best thing that any teacher had ever done for them. They didn&apos;t have to tell me that I already knew that. I don&apos;t teach anymore because there is no money in it and it was boring.  Now I actually work on securing our borders on the ground. You may not like what I say but make no mistake I LOVE THIS GREAT COUNTRY we live in and work my ass off to protect it from drugs, smugglers, criminals and terrorist.   So there it is and frankly I could care less anymore about this topic. No matter what is done things will never be the way we want them. There will always be someone that will break the law (keeps me employed) and whining about it does not help. If you truly want things to change, get active in your community, get active with helping those that come into our country legally to assimilate and you will then demonstrate how great this country is. AS for illegals I beleive like you that they need to go back and go through the process legally. Some don&apos;t have a legal venue even with a clean background because the process does not allow for it unless you have an American Citizen Father, Mother, Brother, Sister or Child to file a petition for you. You and I were lucky that when our ancestors came to this country many years ago (mine were actually here the whole time and fought on the American side to take Texas into the Union)under a buy your ticket to American, sign the registry and WELCOME YOU ARE NOW AN AMERICAN. That is how simple it was. Damn I must be bored to write all of this. I have more to write about but I need to get some sleep so I can chase more bad guys tomorrow. "

Here is some advice, DONT LET citizens vote on SPENDING PROPOSITIONS that affect state spending. Every year there are Propositions for increases Educations spending because &amp;quot;it&apos;s for the children&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;they are the future&amp;quot;. Well my wife is a teacher and she can tell you its all crap. 60  of the state budget goes to Education. That is an actual fact you can look up. Of that 60 , close to 70  goes to salaries in administration, staff and teachers. So why do you think there is always a shortage of money for the classrooms? These are all negotiated contracts. Now granted my wife and I benefit from it but I&apos;m the first to say it&apos;s wrong. (That&apos;s another reason I left teaching)  Her school district is closing two schools because of lack of enrollment. They actually have 1000 fewer students this year than last year. (Don&apos;t know were they went but could have gone back to their home country) There is no over crowding of schools in California. If there were why are school districts crying about lower enrollments and school closings? These layoff need to happen and my wife may be one of them but it is because of bloated budget spending.  Illegal immigration is about  1 billion of the  16 bilion problem and the State not the Feds refuse to enforce residency requirements when it comes to their social wellfare programs. The Feds cannot do anything about it. The only thing that the Feds require is Education and Medical care but everything else is the States Fault. States are the biggest incentive givers to illegal immigration. If you stop the Social Welfare program spigot for illegals by the state, boom you have less illegals settling into your state. The illegal alien problem is part of the problem but our problem is bigger then that and they still refuse to save a billion. "

I just gave up on all the proper stuff with all the distractions I kept getting here.  Grampi46, The Federal Government won&apos;t prosecute state reps for lack of enforcement of immigration laws because technically the state&apos;s lame excuse that it is the Fed&apos;s job is actually on point. Plus they don&apos;t want to spend the money on it even though it benefits the state. The states will aruge that they are sovereign states and do not need to follow certain federal laws that infringe on their state rights or can pass stricter laws then what the Feds put in place in areas that the Federal Government has constitutional authority over. Example would be OSHA Law by the Federal Government are less stringent then California&apos;s OSHA laws. Other examples of this are the Minimum Wage law and the Stricter Emission Standards on car emissions. States will and do argue that their welfare programs are their own and are not subject to Federal jurisdiction. That is why I said the Feds don&apos;t do anything because technically the States are right. The Federal Government is not always the final say in every matter. This is why I always urge people to hammer away at their state assemblymember and state senators to make changes in their Welfare programs to deny illegal aliens these state and even county programs. You find out who is sending the benefit check to the illegal aliens and hit up that state, county or city government to change its ways. Grampi if you or anyone else could find a U.S. Code that states &amp;quot;a state, county, city or other local government agency must verify the legal status of its residents before granting them any State benefit&amp;quot; I would appreciate it. (I could then add that into another post arguing your point about prosecuting state reps) With out a federal law that specifically states that, how does the Federal Government or any Government prosecute someone for a crime?   I agree that the Feds can take away Federal tax dollars from them as tool but generally don&apos;t always do that. They threaten several states with this when the Real ID act was passed to address the residency requirement for issuing IDs and Driver Licenses. Today there are still some states that have not fully implemented it or are challenging it as infringement of state rights. Eventually I believe most of them will because they don&apos;t want to be know as the only state in the union whoes ID won&apos;t allow you to board a plane. "

Read your post and I understand what you said and you have valid points. I didn&apos;t start the thread, but did contribute to it recently.    The problem is NOT with you or men/women like you. You speak-read-write English. You (and your Dad) have served the Nation in our Armed Forces as a good citizen should do! Your Bio says you served as a Navy Corpsman with 3rd Mar Div...     Thank You! Marines appreciate our Corpmen!    The current crop of Illegal aliens from Mexico and Central America are not even attempting to speak-learn the language of the Nation they have entered. They have figured out how to &amp;quot;work-the-system&amp;quot; though... just as I mentioned in the other post. Show up at a Hospital on the North side of the Border and deliver a Baby, then claim that the baby is a citizen, and the mom is now entitled to benefits which are for Americans... That is what irks many of us.    In California, where I spent over 4 and 1/2 decades, the Prisons and jails are FULL of Mexicans who committed crimes in the U.S.A.. The Mexican Government does not want to take them back. The problem is huge and is a Budget buster!    In the city of Santa Ana-- The County Seat of Orange County--- I was going to apply for the posted Police Officer job... until I got to the desk at City Hall, and they said that all applicants must be fluent in &amp;quot;espagnol&amp;quot;. That tells me that there is a huge problem with our Border security. The radio station with the highest listenership in the L.A. area is a spanish language station. La Opinion sells about as many copies as the L.A. Times.

Work and then go home, and let the officials know your name and your face.}     Very few folks mind if somebody wants to come up to the San Juaquin Valley and do some manual labor LEGALLY... But when people come across the border and stay here, put four families in a house made for one family, but refuse to obey the laws of our Nation, refuse to learn the language, and then sign-up for Federal Food Stamps, and Social Security funds, clog up the emergency rooms at Hospitals because they don&apos;t have medical insurance, and send by Western Union money-grams, their earnings back to Mexico instead of spending it here,... it really reeks of wrongness!   In this day and age of moslem-jihadist terrorists, who stay up nights thinking of ways to kill us--- and rampant deseases such as T.B. and various Flu strains from the Asian illegals, and Hepatitis from the the P.I. illegals and who knows-what weird infections/deseases from Central America... We MUST secure the Border!  Cal.Ariz/N.M. are walk across areas... no water to wade thru.    Mexico patrols their southern Border with Guatemala, we should do no less.

While many protest the enforcement of immigration laws, they either fail to realize the consequences, or have alterior motives for an open boarder policy that they can&apos;t see the forest for the trees. They claim we need them here because they do jobs Americans won&apos;t do. Truth is, the &amp;quot;cheap labor&amp;quot; movement has conditioned employers to the point where they&apos;re no longer willing to pay fair wages to law abiding citizens. The result is Americans can&apos;t afford to do these jobs that once paid fair wages so now only the illegals will do them.   Illegals COST American tax payers over  300 billion (that&apos;s right, billion with a &apos;B&amp;quot;) a year in social services. Hospitals are having to close their doors all over the country every day because when illegals show up in their emergency rooms they&apos;re obligated to treat them even though they have no health insurance and can&apos;t pay for their treatment. Classrooms are overcrowded in schools all over the nation because local governments say they must be allowed in our schools. Some schools are even forced to teach Spanish in our schools as a primary language.  What&apos;s it going to take for people to finally wake up and realize how badly illegals are breaking down this country?

When the Germans tried to draft him the Bn Co immediately transferred him the Panama so they couldn&apos;t get him.  We gave him a quick party, and away he went.

But he sure deserved it, and he sure as hell would have given his life for this country as quick as any of us - -  Here&apos;s to you SSG Gonzales, where ever you are!        By the way, in order to enlist, they would obviously have to begin some kind of process that would work towards being here legally - -  T.

Crossing the border illegally is a misdeameanor. Those who&apos;ve been deported  and cross illegally a second time have committed a felony.   You&apos;ve been told they pay taxes, obey the law, and take the jobs that Americans won&apos;t. Sorry, but my experience has been the opposite. They&apos;ll mow lawns and they&apos;ll pick lettuce, but they won&apos;t stay there long. When&apos;s the last time you asked a neighborhood kid to mow your lawn? He&apos;s not getting the  5 or  10 I got as a kid. I don&apos;t know of any cheap lawn service, so I don&apos;t accept their cries of &apos;poverty&apos;.    At the earliest opportunity, they move into the industrial sector. I worked with dozens of them at a firm in Utah. One of the temporary services we used was found to have as many as 4 people using one SSN and living at the same address. They were into overtime by Wednesday of every week and no one at the agency questioned it. The company I worked for didn&apos;t care, because they weren&apos;t paying it.   The contention that they pay taxes is a lie. When they fill out their W-4, they either claim &apos;exempt&apos; status or list enough dependents to eliminate any withholding. Sorry, I&apos;ve watched &apos;em do it. No one can verify how many dependents they have because the address they list is as phony as the SSN they&apos;re using. Whenever human resources mailed out announcements for company functions, hundreds came back as undeliverable. When confronted, they just gave you another bogus address. They&apos;re not paying taxes into a system that they can&apos;t get a refund from; there&apos;s no refund to be had! The only tax they&apos;re paying is Social Security, because they can&apos;t get out of it.   They don&apos;t take health insurance, because they can go to the Emergency Room, be treated, and then dodge payment using the same phony address. They, rent, they don&apos;t buy, so they avoid property taxes. Honest Americans pick up the tab for their medical bills and their kids&apos; education.   The Kennedys and McCains will tell you they&apos;re a religious people, but it&apos;s not the religion this country&apos;s familiar with. They&apos;ve been raised in a &amp;quot;liberation theology&amp;quot; that nurtures the belief that the state owes them everything and anyone that has more than they do is an &apos;oppressor&apos; and obviously stole it from them. The mere fact that they exist &apos;entitles&apos; them; there&apos;s no requirement to earn anything. The underlying philosophy is pure communism.   Don&apos;t think I have a problem with minorities - I spent too long in the Army for that. One of my daughters-in-law is Navajo and Pima and so are my grand kids. Another daughter-in-law is from Kazakhstan and waited over a year to get her green card and emigrate legally.   These people don&apos;t want to be Americans - they want to be foreigners living in America, earning an American living, having their bills paid by someone else, yet still expecting to have a say in how this country&apos;s governed. They don&apos;t want to learn English - instead they think you should be required to learn their language. Fire one, even in an &apos;at will&apos; state such as Utah, and the EEOC folks will call. It was because they&apos;re hispanic and you&apos;re prejudiced, not because they were incompetent, constantly late, or called in sick at least once a week. They&apos;ve no intention of trying to assimilate into our culture. The only reason anyone in America should celebrate Cinco del Mayo is because it recalls one more occasion when somebody kicked the crap out of the French; it&apos;s no more a part of our heritage than Boxing Day or Rose Monday.   Illegal aliens can and should be deported, it won&apos;t cost Americans jobs, and it&apos;s not difficult. Employers&apos; needs can be met with honest &apos;guest workers&apos; and legal immigrants. When you pick up an item and it says &apos;Made in China&apos;, &apos;Product of Chile&apos;, or &apos;Hecho en Mexico&apos;, put it back on the shelf. A simple &apos;read only&apos; on-line system that allows an employer to verify the name and date and place of birth against the SSN already exists. If the SSN doesn&apos;t agree with what the individual standing in front of the desk told you, pick up the phone and call ICE. Hold one hearing, within 48 hours, and then put &apos;em on a bus or plane back to where they came from. Catch &apos;em a second time, you jail them. The Dept of Labor can verify every I-9 an employer has on file in the same manner. If an employer hires an illegal, fine their socks off and put &apos;em out of business. Eliminate the opportunity for illegals to benefit, and the problem will go away. The laws we need currently exist all we need is the will to enforce them.     &amp;quot;....We have room for but one flag, the American flag...

Crossing the border illegally is a misdeameanor. Those who&apos;ve been deported  and cross illegally a second time have committed a felony.   You&apos;ve been told they pay taxes, obey the law, and take the jobs that Americans won&apos;t. Sorry, but my experience has been the opposite. They&apos;ll mow lawns and they&apos;ll pick lettuce, but they won&apos;t stay there long. When&apos;s the last time you asked a neighborhood kid to mow your lawn? He&apos;s not getting the  5 or  10 I got as a kid. I don&apos;t know of any cheap lawn service, so I don&apos;t accept their cries of &apos;poverty&apos;.    At the earliest opportunity, they move into the industrial sector. I worked with dozens of them at a firm in Utah. One of the temporary services we used was found to have as many as 4 people using one SSN and living at the same address. They were into overtime by Wednesday of every week and no one at the agency questioned it. The company I worked for didn&apos;t care, because they weren&apos;t paying it.   The contention that they pay taxes is a lie. When they fill out their W-4, they either claim &apos;exempt&apos; status or list enough dependents to eliminate any withholding. Sorry, I&apos;ve watched &apos;em do it. No one can verify how many dependents they have because the address they list is as phony as the SSN they&apos;re using. Whenever human resources mailed out announcements for company functions, hundreds came back as undeliverable. When confronted, they just gave you another bogus address. They&apos;re not paying taxes into a system that they can&apos;t get a refund from; there&apos;s no refund to be had! The only tax they&apos;re paying is Social Security, because they can&apos;t get out of it.   They don&apos;t take health insurance, because they can go to the Emergency Room, be treated, and then dodge payment using the same phony address. They, rent, they don&apos;t buy, so they avoid property taxes. Honest Americans pick up the tab for their medical bills and their kids&apos; education.   The Kennedys and McCains will tell you they&apos;re a religious people, but it&apos;s not the religion this country&apos;s familiar with. They&apos;ve been raised in a &amp;quot;liberation theology&amp;quot; that nurtures the belief that the state owes them everything and anyone that has more than they do is an &apos;oppressor&apos; and obviously stole it from them. The mere fact that they exist &apos;entitles&apos; them; there&apos;s no requirement to earn anything. The underlying philosophy is pure communism.   Don&apos;t think I have a problem with minorities - I spent too long in the Army for that. One of my daughters-in-law is Navajo and Pima and so are my grand kids. Another daughter-in-law is from Kazakhstan and waited over a year to get her green card and emigrate legally.   These people don&apos;t want to be Americans - they want to be foreigners living in America, earning an American living, having their bills paid by someone else, yet still expecting to have a say in how this country&apos;s governed. They don&apos;t want to learn English - instead they think you should be required to learn their language. Fire one, even in an &apos;at will&apos; state such as Utah, and the EEOC folks will call. It was because they&apos;re hispanic and you&apos;re prejudiced, not because they were incompetent, constantly late, or called in sick at least once a week. They&apos;ve no intention of trying to assimilate into our culture. The only reason anyone in America should celebrate Cinco del Mayo is because it recalls one more occasion when somebody kicked the crap out of the French; it&apos;s no more a part of our heritage than Boxing Day or Rose Monday.   Illegal aliens can and should be deported, it won&apos;t cost Americans jobs, and it&apos;s not difficult. Employers&apos; needs can be met with honest &apos;guest workers&apos; and legal immigrants. When you pick up an item and it says &apos;Made in China&apos;, &apos;Product of Chile&apos;, or &apos;Hecho en Mexico&apos;, put it back on the shelf. A simple &apos;read only&apos; on-line system that allows an employer to verify the name and date and place of birth against the SSN already exists. If the SSN doesn&apos;t agree with what the individual standing in front of the desk told you, pick up the phone and call ICE. Hold one hearing, within 48 hours, and then put &apos;em on a bus or plane back to where they came from. Catch &apos;em a second time, you jail them. The Dept of Labor can verify every I-9 an employer has on file in the same manner. If an employer hires an illegal, fine their socks off and put &apos;em out of business. Eliminate the opportunity for illegals to benefit, and the problem will go away. The laws we need currently exist all we need is the will to enforce them.     &amp;quot;....We have room for but one flag, the American flag... We have room for but one language here, and that is the English language... and we have room for but one sole loyalty and that is a loyalty to the American people.&amp;quot;       Theodore Roosevelt 1907  &quot;</u>   Your words are true and well thought out.

More of the ACLU&apos;s agenda for America.  LANSING- The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a lawsuit aimed at allowing some immigrants living in Michigan to get state-issued driver&apos;s licenses.  Legal immigrants who are not permanent residents have not been able to get driver&apos;s licenses since late last month.  The Legislature is trying to fix state law so legal immigrants can resume getting licenses. But the House and Senate have not yet agreed on a plan.  The ACLU&apos;s immediate goal is to help legal immigrants get driver&apos;s licenses.  But the organization says that all immigrants who live and work in Michigan and intend to stay here should be able to get licenses.   Link

Ulimately if you are a registered voter in the state, it is very easy to vote in national elections.  No proof of citizenship required.  This is a goal of the ACLU in my opinion because they do not believe there should be any immigration restrictions and if you are in the U.S. you should be able to vote.  Why does the ACLU feel this way? Simple; the majority of illegal immigrants are unskilled workers who need government assistance.  Who better to vote for legislative change that increases entitlements but those who get the entitlements?  Ultimately the result is socialism... the stated goal of the founder of the ACLU. "

I hired a company that had a very good reputation for doing the job on time at a reasonable price.  The crew (at least 10 workers) that showed up were all Hispanic (Mexican, El Salvadorian, who knows?).  The foreman spoke some English so I wasn&apos;t to sure about them.  I called the company representative and he assured me that everything would be fine.    These guys had the old roof off and were 90  done with putting the new roof on by the end of the day.  Came back next day and finished up and did a great job.    Then another crew showed up to do the siding.  The supervisor of this crew was a Korean and had  five other workers who were Hispanic.  If it hadn&apos;t been for bad weather last week I&apos;m sure they would have finished in 3 days 4 max.  They just finished today after not being able to work but about two days last week.     When the company rep showed up to check on the job I asked him about how many crews the company had working.  He said it varies but he might have as many as 8-10 crews working at once on jobs. I asked him about the crews being all non-American and he said that they were hard workers and could be depended on.  I said don&apos;t you have any American crews.  He said yes 2.  It was raining slightly that day, but the siding crew had showed up anyway.  He said his American crew called off because it looked like rain.

Let&apos;s hear it for those gonzo immigration cops from the Department of Homeland Security who so heroically swooped down on illegal Wal-Mart janitors last week. No longer will our homeland&apos;s security be threatened by undocumented workers vigorously wielding mops and brooms while good Americans sleep.   The only thing I can&apos;t figure out is, if those janitors worked every night of the year except Christmas and New Year&apos;s, as was reported, when did they have time for terrorism?   Oh, that&apos;s right, the Immigration and Naturalization Service was swept into the new federal mega-agency with the Orwellian name; this wasn&apos;t about finding Al Qaeda operatives embedded among the mostly Christian laborers from Latin America and Eastern Europe, but simply a public relations move to assuage the sensibilities of those xenophobic reactionaries who call for &amp;quot;sealing the borders.&amp;quot;           Because to really stop illegal immigration, without greatly increasing legal immigration from poor countries, would mean wiping out the US agriculture and garment industries, among others. To blame the workers, rather than the system they operate in, is the core hypocrisy our immigration policy has long been based upon.   If we really wanted to stop illegal immigrant workers from coming into this country, it would be straightforward and simple: require a tamper-proof identity card for any applicant for a job in this country and impose stiff criminal penalties on employers who hire people who do not provide the requisite card. But enforceable sanctions would be opposed by most major business associations because employers would no longer be able to find a vulnerable labor force to exploit. Undocumented immigrants come here to work. If jobs didn&apos;t exist, the number crossing the border, mostly from Latin America, would plummet.   That&apos;s how you &amp;quot;seal the borders.&amp;quot;   But the cost for ending those jobs would be high. Ending the endemic use of undocumented workers in low-wage, dead-end jobs would force employers to pay real wages and offer real benefits to attract &amp;quot;real Americans&amp;quot; to do the work, and some jobs would simply leave the country. Prices for food, clothing and any product that relies on dirt-cheap labor would rise for everybody, and those middle- and upper-class families that count on don&apos;t-ask, don&apos;t-tell relationships with undocumented housekeepers, gardeners, nannies and elder-care workers would be affected.   That is the conundrum faced by California Gov.-elect Arnold Schwarzenegger. In his campaign, he demagogically railed that a new law permitting undocumented immigrants to obtain a driver&apos;s license threatened national security. Yet many of the people who voted for him employ illegal immigrants and even expect them to ferry their children about. Why in the world wouldn&apos;t they want those people to prove they are properly qualified to drive? And why can&apos;t they make do with legal workers?   The answer is they are greedy and cheap, just like the executives of Wal-Mart. Too many employers are unwilling to abide by labor laws governing pay, overtime and worker safety that would attract legal workers. The undocumented workers are used to undermine the hard-won gains of the American labor movement. Three supermarket chains in California are currently trying to break their unions, citing the encroachment of Wal-Mart on their turf even as their profits soar.   Who will replace some of these workers if they aren&apos;t willing to give up salary and basic benefits? Take a guess.   As a matter of justice, we have to stop pitting one group of workers against another. The first step would be to make the undocumented workers already here legal. Or, failing that humane step, eliminate the jobs for undocumented workers by toughening the law on hiring--and arresting employers who violate the law. We must increase the number of legal immigrants allowed annually, particularly from Mexico with its strong family and historic ties to this country. Also, immigration laws have been rigged to favor certain skilled occupations, ignoring the reality that much of our prosperity derives from the sweat of unskilled immigrant labor.   It is sad that our Austrian-born governor-elect, who qualified for US citizenship mainly on the basis of his familiarity with dumbbells, should be so willing to exploit immigrant-bashing to win votes from nativist hypocrites.   Let&apos;s stop politicizing economic immigration--or making it a &amp;quot;security&amp;quot; issue--and start implementing obvious, fair and pragmatic solutions.

I hired a company that had a very good reputation for doing the job on time at a reasonable price.  The crew (at least 10 workers) that showed up were all Hispanic (Mexican, El Salvadorian, who knows?).  The foreman spoke some English so I wasn&apos;t to sure about them.  I called the company representative and he assured me that everything would be fine.    These guys had the old roof off and were 90  done with putting the new roof on by the end of the day.  Came back next day and finished up and did a great job.    Then another crew showed up to do the siding.  The supervisor of this crew was a Korean and had  five other workers who were Hispanic.  If it hadn&apos;t been for bad weather last week I&apos;m sure they would have finished in 3 days 4 max.  They just finished today after not being able to work but about two days last week.     When the company rep showed up to check on the job I asked him about how many crews the company had working.  He said it varies but he might have as many as 8-10 crews working at once on jobs. I asked him about the crews being all non-American and he said that they were hard workers and could be depended on.  I said don&apos;t you have any American crews.  He said yes 2.  It was raining slightly that day, but the siding crew had showed up anyway.  He said his American crew called off because it looked like rain.  Both these crews were most likely sub-contractors I&apos;m not sure.  What this tells me is that if a company can&apos;t find U.S. citizens to do the work what other choice does the company have.  I can&apos;t say one way or the other if there were any illegals in the crews or not.  They could all be here with green cards and working for peanuts but I doubt it.  The key word in my mind is WORKING.    They did a damn good job and I&apos;m very happy with the finished product.    My point is that these men were hard workers and did a fantastic job.  Where they came from didn&apos;t bother me in the least.  In this part of Pennsylvania there are a lot of orchards and if wasn&apos;t for the migrants nothing would get picked.

Let&apos;s hear it for those gonzo immigration cops from the Department of Homeland Security who so heroically swooped down on illegal Wal-Mart janitors last week. No longer will our homeland&apos;s security be threatened by undocumented workers vigorously wielding mops and brooms while good Americans sleep.   The only thing I can&apos;t figure out is, if those janitors worked every night of the year except Christmas and New Year&apos;s, as was reported, when did they have time for terrorism?   Oh, that&apos;s right, the Immigration and Naturalization Service was swept into the new federal mega-agency with the Orwellian name; this wasn&apos;t about finding Al Qaeda operatives embedded among the mostly Christian laborers from Latin America and Eastern Europe, but simply a public relations move to assuage the sensibilities of those xenophobic reactionaries who call for &amp;quot;sealing the borders.&amp;quot;           Because to really stop illegal immigration, without greatly increasing legal immigration from poor countries, would mean wiping out the US agriculture and garment industries, among others. To blame the workers, rather than the system they operate in, is the core hypocrisy our immigration policy has long been based upon.   If we really wanted to stop illegal immigrant workers from coming into this country, it would be straightforward and simple: require a tamper-proof identity card for any applicant for a job in this country and impose stiff criminal penalties on employers who hire people who do not provide the requisite card. But enforceable sanctions would be opposed by most major business associations because employers would no longer be able to find a vulnerable labor force to exploit. Undocumented immigrants come here to work. If jobs didn&apos;t exist, the number crossing the border, mostly from Latin America, would plummet.   That&apos;s how you &amp;quot;seal the borders.&amp;quot;   But the cost for ending those jobs would be high. Ending the endemic use of undocumented workers in low-wage, dead-end jobs would force employers to pay real wages and offer real benefits to attract &amp;quot;real Americans&amp;quot; to do the work, and some jobs would simply leave the country. Prices for food, clothing and any product that relies on dirt-cheap labor would rise for everybody, and those middle- and upper-class families that count on don&apos;t-ask, don&apos;t-tell relationships with undocumented housekeepers, gardeners, nannies and elder-care workers would be affected.   That is the conundrum faced by California Gov.-elect Arnold Schwarzenegger. In his campaign, he demagogically railed that a new law permitting undocumented immigrants to obtain a driver&apos;s license threatened national security. Yet many of the people who voted for him employ illegal immigrants and even expect them to ferry their children about. Why in the world wouldn&apos;t they want those people to prove they are properly qualified to drive? And why can&apos;t they make do with legal workers?   The answer is they are greedy and cheap, just like the executives of Wal-Mart. Too many employers are unwilling to abide by labor laws governing pay, overtime and worker safety that would attract legal workers. The undocumented workers are used to undermine the hard-won gains of the American labor movement. Three supermarket chains in California are currently trying to break their unions, citing the encroachment of Wal-Mart on their turf even as their profits soar.   Who will replace some of these workers if they aren&apos;t willing to give up salary and basic benefits? Take a guess.   As a matter of justice, we have to stop pitting one group of workers against another. The first step would be to make the undocumented workers already here legal. Or, failing that humane step, eliminate the jobs for undocumented workers by toughening the law on hiring--and arresting employers who violate the law. We must increase the number of legal immigrants allowed annually, particularly from Mexico with its strong family and historic ties to this country. Also, immigration laws have been rigged to favor certain skilled occupations, ignoring the reality that much of our prosperity derives from the sweat of unskilled immigrant labor.   It is sad that our Austrian-born governor-elect, who qualified for US citizenship mainly on the basis of his familiarity with dumbbells, should be so willing to exploit immigrant-bashing to win votes from nativist hypocrites.   Let&apos;s stop politicizing economic immigration--or making it a &amp;quot;security&amp;quot; issue--and start implementing obvious, fair and pragmatic solutions.

Representatives from Alltel Corp., Tyson Foods Inc. and Stephens Inc. announced an unlikely alliance with the American Civil Liberties Union, outspoken state appeals court judge Wendell Griffen and others to form the Arkansas Friendship Coalition.  &amp;quot;State and local governments should not be involving themselves in issues that only Congress can really address,&amp;quot; said Archie Schaffer, senior vice president for external affairs for Tyson. The coalition announced its formation at events in Springdale and Little Rock.  Steve Copley, the coalition&apos;s chairman, would not say specifically which measures the group would oppose, and the coalition&apos;s Web site and news release repeatedly referred to &amp;quot;punitive&amp;quot; measures targeting immigrants. But the effort comes after a series of hearings by Republican lawmakers focusing on the cost of services related to illegal immigrants.  Members of the coalition cited a failed effort during the legislative session this year that would have criminalized harboring or transportation of illegal immigrants. They also noted agreements four northwest Arkansas police agencies signed with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to enforce federal immigration law  &amp;quot;These are very punitive laws, and they create a general atmosphere of hostility,&amp;quot; said Alan Leveritt, publisher of the Arkansas Times and El Latino newspapers. &amp;quot;If you happen a Latino person, do you really want to drive through the city of Rogers with a tail light out? It creates a general problem.&amp;quot;  Copley, pastor of the First United Methodist Church in North Little Rock, said he is also opposed to Gov. Mike Beebe&apos;s request that Arkansas State Police pursue an agreement with the federal government that would allow troopers to enforce immigration law.  &amp;quot;We just think it would be a new burden and a new cost,&amp;quot; Copley said.  Copley, however, said he did not believe that Beebe was moving toward supporting immigration measures that his group would call punitive. Last week, the governor said that the Hispanic community has a &amp;quot;disconnect&amp;quot; when it comes to the subject of illegal immigration.  &amp;quot;If it is illegal, it means it&apos;s illegal,&amp;quot; Beebe said.  Monday, Beebe called the coalition &amp;quot;an admirable undertaking&amp;quot; on a controversial subject.  &amp;quot;The federal government&apos;s inconsistent and unclear immigration policy has left all states, including Arkansas, in the difficult position of trying to care for all their residents while respecting federal laws that often go unenforced,&amp;quot; Beebe said.  Beebe spokesman Matt DeCample said the governor was open to discussing Copley&apos;s concerns about immigration enforcement by state troopers, but noted that no agreement has been signed. The governor has said any agreement with the federal government about the program must include details on what the federal government will do if any illegal immigrants are taken into custody by state police. Beebe said local and state prisons don&apos;t have room to take in illegal immigrants.  &amp;quot;Right now, it&apos;s in the very preliminary discussion stage,&amp;quot; DeCample said.  Rep. Jon Woods, who has pushed for stricter measures targeting illegal immigrants at the state level, said he believed the group is trying to mislead people by presenting itself as a group lobbying for all immigrants. Woods, R-Springdale, said he believes the group is only trying to protect people who are in the country illegally.  &amp;quot;They&apos;re trying to prevent us from doing what the people have asked us to do, which is enforce the law,&amp;quot; Woods said.  Griffen, who is also a Baptist preacher, said he did not believe he had a conflict of interest by supporting a group lobbying against immigration legislation. Last month, a judicial ethics panel dropped charges against Griffen over comments the judge made about the Bush administration&apos;s handling of Hurricane Katrina, minimum wage, the war in Iraq, and against critics of immigrants and homosexuals.  &amp;quot;Any notion of morality that subjects a stranger to a different and lower level of treatment than one allowed to someone who is native born is in almost every way wicked,&amp;quot; Griffen said. &amp;quot;So I don&apos;t know why there&apos;s a great deal of effort to justify the wicked and the illegal at the expense of the vulnerable.&amp;quot; These groups are trying to keep their cheap labor at the expense of American citizens.

The voice of identity theft victims.  Behind many of the nation s millions of undocumented workers are someone else&apos;s documents. To get a job, illegal immigrants need a Social Security number, and they often borrow one. As victim Melody Millet is fond of saying, U.S. citizens are being forced to share their identities with undocumented immigrants to give corporate America a steady supply of cheap labor.  N_immigration_idtheft_060402300w MSNBC.com reporter Bob Sullivan talks about illegal immigration and identity theft on MSNBC.    Thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of Americans are right now sharing their identities with immigrants and don&apos;t know it. It is the dirty little secret of the immigration issue: By not dealing directly with the undocumented worker situation, the U.S government is actually encouraging identity theft. In fact, one can argue that the origins of the identity theft epidemic can be traced to the immigration issue.  The scope of this problem is vast. Every year, nearly 9 million people pay their taxes using the wrong Social Security number. The name used on W-2 tax forms used by employers doesn&apos;t match the name on file with the Social Security Administration. There can be many reasons why -- a data entry typo by a human resources department, a woman changes her name after marriage and forgets to report it, or a man uses someone else&apos;s SSN to get a job.  Social Security calls this a &amp;quot;no-match&amp;quot; situation. When this happens, the Social Security Administration collects the money, but the wage credits go into limbo. They don&apos;t end up on anyone&apos;s annual Social Security statement, they end up in something called the Earnings Suspense File. Since 1984, when the Social Security card employment verification requirement kicked in, nearly  500 billion in wages has ended up in that file.  Who are all these people paying their taxes using the wrong SSN? Neither Social Security nor the IRS has ever studied this issue in great detail. But there are clear indications that many -- if not most -- of the 9 million mismatches are immigrants using the wrong SSN. One study by Social Security indicates no-match payments come most frequently from agricultural and restaurant industries, for example.  Not every mismatched SSN belongs to a real living person, and in fact, it appears many are chosen at random. Some belong to the deceased; others are entirely fictitious. One study showed thousands of entries using obvious fakes, such as 123-45-6789 or 999-99-9999.  Many victims are very real But many victims are very real. Recently, officials in Utah matched a database of children receiving welfare benefits with a database of workers paying state taxes and found 1,800 child victims. It s impossible to know how many of the impostors were undocumented workers, but Utah Assistant Attorney General Rich Hamp says that behind most cases the agency has prosecuted so far, he s found an immigrant using someone else s papers.  Victims often don&apos;t have any idea they re sharing their identity with an immigrant, because there&apos;s no way to find out. Social Security won&apos;t tell you if someone else is using your SSN. The extra earnings don&apos;t end up on your annual Social Security statement, because they are designated to the Earnings Suspense File instead. Ditto for the Internal Revenue Service. The misuse isn&apos;t revealed in personal credit reports, either. If somebody uses your number to get a credit card or car loan, the nation&apos;s credit bureaus create a new credit file instead of alerting you to the misuse.  Victims only find out when something goes wrong -- when there are unpaid taxes or unpaid bills, debt collectors often track down the original SSN holder.  But there are sometimes hints along the way.  SSN-only ID theft victim Margaret Harrison was once denied unemployment because records showed she had a job. Harrison was in West Virginia -- her Social Security number was working on a farm in Washington state. She couldn&apos;t prove her problem until recently, however, when she received a debit card with her impostor&apos;s picture on it.  The immigration issue is an incredibly complex mine field of competing emotional issues. There are sloganeering and extremism on both sides. There will be no kicking out every undocumented worker; and there will be no letting everyone in right away. People who insist on either are naive, foolish or both. There will be hard decisions and heartbreaks. This column does not suggest there is a simple answer.  And it also does not blame the immigrants, who are simply following the real-life rules they ve been given. Want a job? Want to feed your family, want a better life for your kids? Just get a nine-digit number. The message has been clear from our government and our corporations for 20 years -- no one cares whose nine-digit number you use.  Plenty of blame to go around The blame lies on us all for not dealing with the situation directly, and instead encouraging under-the-table activity. There are millions of victims on all sides -- including the innocent bystanders who must share their Social Security numbers.  This is what happens when an extra-legal system is in place. Today, there are no rules, which clearly encourages this sharing of Social Security numbers. It encourages the cottage industry that is document forgery. And ultimately, it encourages identity theft.  While consumers cannot learn the secret life of their Social Security numbers, several groups know all about it. The nation s credit bureaus, for example, can sort their data by number instead of name.  Lenders routinely buy this information when assessing a consumer&apos;s credit risk. Every time MSNBC.com covers this issue, workers at car dealers and banks write in to say they ve seen countless examples of consumers who apply for accounts and have multiple names connected to their Social Security numbers. Privacy rules prevent them from warning the consumers.  And of course, any agency that collects taxes, such as Social Security or the IRS, has this information.  It would certainly be possible for any of these groups to inform those who are sharing SSNs, but a serious attempt has never been made. Why? I suspect that doing so would personalize the immigration debate and might very well lead to a true flash point for the issue.  Three years ago, Social Security did the next-best thing, sending letters to some employers with large lists of people paying taxes using the wrong SSN. As workers scattered, seeing the letters as tantamount to a deportation notice, immigration rights groups protested. The letters were immediately withdrawn. And here we sit.  One thing activists on many sides of this issue seem to agree on  - it s time to bring undocumented workers out of the shadows. That would be wise, as it would also bring countless identity theft victims out of the shadows.  But until that happens, the IRS, the SSA and the nation s credit bureaus need to develop a system that allows the rightful holder of a Social Security number to know if it has a secret life. "

(AP) -- Attorneys will ask a federal judge Wednesday to put a hold on a new law that would crack down on illegal immigration in Oklahoma. A federal lawsuit challenging the law, which goes into effect Thursday, was refiled last week. It added eight undocumented residents who plan to testify that they will face eviction from their landlords unless they provide legal identification, such as a social security card, as required by the new law.  The other plaintiffs include the National Coalition of Latino Clergy and two churches.  Last week, U.S. District Judge James H. Payne dismissed the plaintiff&apos;s first lawsuit, saying they could not prove the law damaged them. The hearing on the preliminary injunction is set before the same judge.  &amp;quot;If the judge does not do the preliminary injunction, here&apos;s a primary example of eight people who will be evicted,&amp;quot; said Rohit Sharma, attorney for the plaintiffs.  Considered one of the toughest in the nation, House Bill 1804 creates barriers for undocumented immigrants to receive public benefits and jobs. It also makes it illegal to transport or harbor illegal immigrants, making violations a felony punishable by a minimum of one year in prison or a  1,000 fine.  Sebastian Lantos, a court-certified Spanish interpreter and Tulsa community activist, says House Bill 1804 will cause the economy to suffer and further divide the community.  Thousands of Hispanics already have left the city ahead of the new law taking effect.  &amp;quot;The worst thing to me is that we lost a sense of belonging to the city,&amp;quot; Lantos said. &amp;quot;We see our neighbors leaving, we see the unfairness.    The mentality of the community has to change,&amp;quot; said Lantos.  The author of the legislation, Representative Randy Terrill, R-Moore, said Monday he remained confident the bill will hold up in court.  &amp;quot;We&apos;re talking about a group of people who have had five or six months to plaintiff shop, forum shop and judge shop to find somebody who is sympathetic to their cause,&amp;quot; Terrill said.  Last month, five Democratic state lawmakers asked Attorney General Drew Edmondson to clarify several provisions of the measure. Because there were about two dozen questions, an opinion from the office appears unlikely before Thursday.  These people are idiots. the people should lose their places to live, no SS card  illegal in my book. SS cards are not that hard to get if you are legal. "

Since this has become a more specific legal discussion, I will defer to other who are more qualified to argue specific points.  But just so you think I&apos;m not dodging you, I will offer up what I believe is a reasonable response.  First, laws governing citizenship were created based on the premise that the persons in question were, in fact, legally here asking to be included in those rights given to our citizens.  If you come here illegally, you have made no such plea with the USG, therefore are not subject to our laws.  Second, children are typically given the status of the parents in most situations.  I don&apos;t see why this isn&apos;t applied to citizenship as well.  Until they can speak for themselves, why aren&apos;t the subject to the same things their parents are subject to?  I know what the pertinent Constitutional reference say, I highlighted it in your previous post and I agreed.  Where you and I disagree is how that is applied, which you indicated by your absence of knowledge in this area.  I would expect that citizenship is applied to the head of household and to all who reside in it.  We can leave it at that.  And you are also correct about diplomats.  I served time with diplomatic status overseas, and my second son is eligible for Colombian citizenship if he should so choose to pursue it.  But it&apos;s not automatic.  It depends on agreements between the countries in question.  That goes for criminal law as well.  Again, I defer to legal experts here, but that&apos;s been my experience.  In no case have I ever heard that it&apos;s a presumption, no matter what country we&apos;re talking about.  Including the U.S.A."

I see our relationship with our government as a collaborative arrangement.  Remember, one of our forefathers was quoted (I think it was Hamilton) as saying that our form of government was predicated upon the believe that the governed would by default, police themselves.  It&apos;s only because people fail to do this that the government needs to step in at all.  I see that as our failure, not the government&apos;s.  Now you suggest that the government bears total responsibility and we owe them nothing.  How does that work, exactly?  We take but we don&apos;t give?

Which makes me think it appeals to the soap opera crowd.  I mean, who else could stand having years of transgressions dumped on you in one sitting the way they tend to do?  From where I sit, the media doesn&apos;t help anyone but themselves.  They are in business to sell the news, and will turn over any rock they can to expose a controversy.  The problem is, it generally exposes issues that are important to just a small area, and the majority in their markets aren&apos;t at all concerned.  I think this plays a big part in the mindset of the general public and how they deal with not only community issues, but state and national issues as well.  I have to be honest, I don&apos;t have a clue as to how we can fix that.

I called the company representative and he assured me that everything would be fine.    These guys had the old roof off and were 90  done with putting the new roof on by the end of the day.  Came back next day and finished up and did a great job.    Then another crew showed up to do the siding.  The supervisor of this crew was a Korean and had  five other workers who were Hispanic.  If it hadn&apos;t been for bad weather last week I&apos;m sure they would have finished in 3 days 4 max.  They just finished today after not being able to work but about two days last week.     When the company rep showed up to check on the job I asked him about how many crews the company had working.  He said it varies but he might have as many as 8-10 crews working at once on jobs. I asked him about the crews being all non-American and he said that they were hard workers and could be depended on.  I said don&apos;t you have any American crews.  He said yes 2.  It was raining slightly that day, but the siding crew had showed up anyway.  He said his American crew called off because it looked like rain.

Because of this website s coverage of the issue and your action, the story grew, and FEMA finally made a statement saying that they would permanently withhold that grant from ACORN.  Thank you for raising awareness of this clear waste of first responder funding that could go to countless needy volunteer firefighter organizations or other first responders.  This week, I wanted to make you aware of a growing concern about the U.S. Census and illegal aliens and how the two could drastically affect congressional apportionment and possibly your own state s congressional representation.   In the past, some states have included illegal aliens in the collection of census data, and this has often resulted in the allocation of additional congressional seats to those states   at the expense of other states that lose seats because of the skewed data.   Illegal aliens shouldn t be included for the purposes of determining representation in Congress.  I don t believe that this is what our founding fathers had in mind when they laid out our current system of representation.  Illegal immigration is a very real and significant concern for our country.  We shouldn t let these states be rewarded for skirting our federal laws.   That s why this week, I introduced an amendment to the Commerce, Justice and Science Appropriations bill that would require questions in the census regarding citizenship and immigration status. The amendment is, of course, designed to help us identify illegal aliens, primarily to prevent states from counting them for the purposes of determining population levels and other data associated with the census.  The data collected during the census is used by Congress to determine multiple issues of importance beyond apportionment, including government program spending levels.  Essentially, my amendment would prevent funding from being used to collect census data that does not include a question regarding United States citizenship and immigration status.  It s a very simple and direct amendment that can help us bring about a very positive change.  It obviously won t help us identify all illegal aliens, but it s a step in the right direction.  Source:  http://biggovernment.com/2009/10/08/will-the-census-count-illegal-immigrants/   I spoke of a similar problem a few weeks ago by providing links to the Census.

The alarming, but not surprising, information is revealed in a new report published by the Justice Department s  National Gang Intelligence Center  (NGIC), an FBI task force created in 2005 to curb the growing threat of violent gangs in the U.S. The NGIC teams up with state and local law enforcement agencies throughout the nation to enforce, study and intercept gangs and has published several reports documenting their activities.   The agency s latest publication has not been made public but a  national newspaper   revealed some of its findings this week. It says that up to 80  of crime in the U.S. is committed by gangs and that gang membership in this country has grown to 1 million, an increase of 200,000 in the last few years.   Additionally, gangs are the &amp;quot;primary retail-level distributors of most illicit drugs&amp;quot; in the U.S. and several are sophisticated enough to compete with major Mexican drug-trafficking cartels. Most of the country s state and local enforcement agencies have reported gang activity in their jurisdiction and the problem will only get worse, according to the FBI.  In fact, a high-ranking FBI director said gangs have followed the migration paths of illegal alien laborers to avoid big-city police departments that have cracked down on their activities. An example is the notoriously violent Salvadoran gang known as  Mara Salvatrucha  or MS-13, which has spread throughout the U.S. to at least 42 states and continues expanding.   In 2008 alone MS-13 members, all illegal immigrants with previous criminal records, committed atrocious crimes that received ample media coverage. In San Francisco an MS-13 gang banger murdered a father and son with an assault weapon because their car blocked his from making a turn. In Los Angeles an MS-13 member just released from prison murdered a high school football star as the teen jock walked home from the mall. In Maryland a 14-year-old honors high school student was shot to death on a crowded public bus by a Salvadoran illegal alien who proudly revealed he belonged to the MS-13.    http://www.judicialwatch.org/blog/2009/jan/illegal-immigrant-gangs-commit-most-u-s-crime  "

This would of course not stop any illegal alien from checking the box or providing SSAN, then mail. At the very least it would be a very small deterrent.  The only solid way would be door to door with SS card, birth certificate in hand and use an I-9 method of checking. A one time near thorough check would result in new congressional boundaries and the proper fair amount of representation of the people in a state; for once.

This was not just a Bush made up claim.  The UN backed that up.  It was not just Bush who thought he had weapons, other countries had the same intel.  It looks like Saddam was bluffing all the time and I guess he told people in the end the reason he bluffed and messed with the inspectors is because he wanted Iran to think he had them.  Whatever the reason, he created enough doubt that when we were attacked we had enough doubt there to call Saddams bluff.  I never said Iraq attacked us.  After 9/11 we really did not know who the players were and we over reacted rather than not reacting at all.  Unfortunately for Iraq, because of Saddams games it gave Bush enough support to go in and set up camp.  Anyway, you can&apos;t totally blame it all on Bush or America....we woke up to the 9/11 attack, it is like poking a sleeping bear.  It is kinda hard to see where the good guys end and the bad buys begin in this war of terror on the west.  There are so many arms and branches and long long line of hatered with a promise of death to the west, so we can&apos;t really look the other way and ignor it when you have foun planes being hijacked, flown into buildings full of innocent people, etc etc&quot;</u>   Look, the cards are on the table now and discussing the way we got into Iraq is not going to change anyone&apos;s mind. You will always believe what you have stated and I will believe that Bush and Friends were dead set on going into Iraq and that they cherry picked and managed intel to solidify the ruse they were putting over on the American public.   There was not a universal agreement upon the intel they used, in fact there were as many arguing against it in English, Spanish and French intelligence as were arguing for it although Israeli and Iranian intel solidly backed Bush and Cheney so there were many strange bedfellows here. The main point was that he was under the world&apos;s microscope and certainly contained. The French, who are in fact very good in that part of the world, had some solid info that there were those in his army and security forces who wanted him gone and were not totally opposed to an assist from the west.  They were told to enact the surge from the first day of the occupation but the guy who told them they would need at least 400,000 troops was fired and the guy who told them the guy they fired was right was exiled to Ft. Leavenworth. His name was Patraeus.   Everybody that told them the truth was either ignored or punished because they were simply not interested in any input that contrasted with what they had already decided. If they would have just been a little more honest and a little less greedy and a lot more patient they might have accomplished their ends without all the bloodshed and violence, who knows.   Look, If you&apos;re gonna do the damn thing and invade Iraq then at least do it right even if it&apos;s wrong. You get to be ruthless and smart or just ruthless. Ruthless is going in there with the force level we had, kill the ones we have to and need to, then get the hell out. We&apos;ve left a ruined city, some dead guys and people who hate us but nobody can say we didn&apos;t kick ass.   Being ruthless and smart means we wait a bit, get enough force to win the damn occupation, go in and occupy the territory we take, make the people feel secure, kill the bad guys they tell us about and repair the infrastructure and stay there to kill the bad guys that come back to avenge the dead bad guys we killed awhile ago. That&apos;s what General Patraeus did in the 101st AO and it was one of the most peaceful and progressive until he got exiled for expressing his criticism of the way the war was being handled to some who saw him as a dangerous rival.  So as far as I&apos;m concerned, you can&apos;t just take Bush and Cheney off the hook by saying they were duped by bad intel along with the rest of the world. These men and the ones that surround them were not stupid, they knew exactly what they were doing. Never get stupid and incompetent mixed up. They are not synonyms and they can be mutually exclusive.

Anger is mounting over the security lapses that allowed the bombers to drive trucks past checkpoints and position them close to government targets that included the foreign and finance ministries. Wednesday&apos;s attacks killed at least 101 people and wounded more than 500.  The violence has shaken confidence in a government eager to demonstrate that it can take over responsibility for the country&apos;s security from American troops, who withdrew form Iraq&apos;s cities nearly two months ago.  &amp;quot;We have to face the truth.

From 1997 to 2000, he was commander-in-chief of the United States Central Command, in charge of all American troops in the Middle East. That was the same job held by Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf before him, and Gen. Tommy Franks after.   Following his retirement from the Marine Corps, the Bush administration thought so highly of Zinni that it appointed him to one of its highest diplomatic posts -- special envoy to the Middle East.   But Zinni broke ranks with the administration over the war in Iraq, and now, in his harshest criticism yet, he says senior officials at the Pentagon are guilty of dereliction of duty -- and that the time has come for heads to roll. Correspondent Steve Kroft reports.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  There has been poor strategic thinking in this,  says Zinni.

If you had any idea what you are dribbling all over these boards, you&apos;d stop....apologize....and get back into reality.  As PinkBlossoms had posted earlier:       I oppose the war, but I support the troops.   What does that mean? If the troops you support win the war you oppose, will you be happy or sad?   Pure nonsense. This is the babbling of cowards. If you oppose the war, you can&apos;t possibly support the troops whose only business in Iraq is to make the war you oppose. If you support the troops, you can&apos;t possibly oppose the victory they are fighting and dying to achieve.      To be oppossed to the war is one thing, but to openly disagree with it in a   public   forum, in these days of electronic  idiocy - madness - craziness  wonder, is insane. All forms of electronic communication, whether it be TV, radio, cell-phone, e-mail (to include these boards) are subject to being used as propaganda against our Soldiers. The Dixie Wimps and the recent incidence of the old biddies that held up the &amp;quot;We did not vote for President Bush&amp;quot; sign are, IMO, treasonous acts. Even more so are the actions of our elected persons in the Congress of the United States. These people are there to help this country, not hamstring it in the name of partisanship. Any elected official that has spoken out against this war, or against the President because of this war, will not get my vote. You don&apos;t have to   like   scrapping the carp off of the bottom of your shoes before you come into my house, you just have to do it.  I dislike war as much as anyone, and more than some, but by all that I hold dear, I will support this country and it&apos;s military to the end, once the path to war has begun.   These are my feelings and no one else need agree with me, but I cannot see how a person can divide their support between the Soldier and the charge that has been placed upon him/her.  For me, to support the Soldier is to support the war that they are fighting. Anything less than that causes undue hardship, death, and prolongs the war. &quot;</u>   I couldn&apos;t agree more, 440!

iraq_war,409192893_3480004751001,35,GlassOnion,Tue 27 November 2007 01:11 PM,"A question for those against the war   Were you against the war  before  we went into Iraq?  Were you against it when Bush gave Saddam the ultimatum  open the gates or we ll open them for you  then patiently waited an additional 6-months?  Bush didn t like waiting because he knew this was giving Saddam time to prepare.  Were you against the war before or after the Democrats began their manipulations and lies about the war and especially the President?  Did you know in 1999    The world&apos;s most wanted man,  Osama bin Laden, has been offered sanctuary in Iraq  if his worldwide terrorist network succeeds in carrying out a campaign of high-profile attacks on the West over the next few weeks.  Intelligence sources say the Saudi dissident believed responsible for the bombings of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and a US military barracks in Saudi Arabia in 1998, is running out of options for a safe haven.  He is now thought to have overcome his initial rejection of Saddam Hussein, whom he regarded as an exploiter of the Islamic cause rather than a true believer, and is considering the offer of a bolt-hole from which he can continue to mastermind terrorism on a global scale    Did you ever hear any of these things   September 24, 2002, 4:37 PM (GMT 02:00)  DEBKAfile s readers were not taken aback by the Israeli Shin Beit s (Security Service) disclosure on September 23 that it had custody of a  three-man Palestinian cell from Ramallah who trained in Iraq with Iraqi instructors  in the execution of strikes against Israeli targets - in the company of al Qaeda terrorists .  . Indeed, Tirawi and Abu al-Abbas were entrusted with setting up the murder.  Arafat asked Saddam Hussein  to get rid of Abu Nidal, claiming he was on the point of passing to American parties in the Persian Gulf evidence of the  three-way partnership-for-terror forged by Arafat, Saddam and bin Laden . Arafat relayed his request to the Iraqi leader through Ahmed Azzam, Arafat s special envoy to Baghdad, together with Al-Abbas.  Saddam gave his assent at the beginning of August. The plan of operation entailed Abu Nidal s regular contacts in Iraqi intelligence calling on him and, when he opened the door unsuspectingly, standing aside for the Palestinians to burst in and do the deed.. -------------------------  Did you know Al-Sadr actually accepted a surrender in exchange for a position within the Iraqi interim government    THEN    4-days AFTER Senator Ted Kennedy made his infamous speech    illegal war, etc,  this will be George Bush s Vietnam  only 4-days later after accepting PEACE   Al-Sadr CHANGED HIS MIND    Radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr accepted a peace plan Wednesday to end fighting in Najaf that would disarm his militiamen and remove them from a holy shrine where they are hiding out, according to an al-Sadr spokesman    I call upon the American people to stand beside their brethren, the Iraqi people, who are suffering an injustice by your rulers and the occupying army, to help them in the transfer of power to honest Iraqis. Otherwise,  Iraq will be another Vietnam  for America and the occupiers   One other point about that particular comment of supporting the troops but not the war from Kennedy   39 marines lost their lives during that fight  If Kennedy had kept his mouth shut at least a few more days, maybe a few of those men would be coming home?  But then, Kennedy had to make his political move   John Kerry had just begun his campaign run   to my knowledge Kennedy s statement was the first MAJOR public descent by using a media blitz.  That also marked the beginning of the major influx of insurgents.  Did you know for instance there was an Airliner Fuselage 20-miles south of Baghdad where Al Qaeda trained to hijack planes   PRIOR TO SEPT 11, 2001  but no worries, the UN said Iraq was only using the Fuselage for anti-hijackers coming into Iraq from Iran   Yea, okay, and when was the last time someone changed their bong-water ?  Honestly, were you against the war before we went into Iraq or was it afterwards   Do you think the war COULD have gone differently  IF  the democrats would have fully supported the President?   Just a thought   I ve always found that most folks  turned  against the war because of the negativity persistently propagated by the Democrats   all for the hopes of a few extra seats.  I mean, was it really necessary for Reid to say we LOST   or some of the other comments coming from the US Senate Floor   like our soldiers are murderers, rapists, thugs, torturing innocent Iraqi families, etc, etc   Anyone who doesn t think these type comments contributed to the demise of this war, doesn t understand the nature nor the people we are fighting.  I was debating hard-core Islamists extremists when our despicable senators started whining about Abu Garb and Gitmo   those extremists literally short-circuited   Just something to ponder . "

I have also said, there are points I dont agree with, but I will not shout them out.   You read some of what I said, it will say that I want to show a unified front for the world, but still want checks and balances on how its handled, that should be done at home and not spread over the world to see.   As for our troops killed over there, how many of them were innocent woman and children, flying in a plane? How many jumped to there deaths because some idiot fly a plane into the building. How many more terrorists acts would have happened if we didnt go over there and stop them???  IF we dont stop them there, they will get back here and do it again. Listen to all the attempts made and films showing them still training for attacks against us.   NOPE, kill them there, not here..."

You cannot lie to the US public and expect them to support a given policy.  We saw this in Vietnam.    The war in Iraq has now killed more Americans than died on 9/11.  The terrorist were not in Iraq prior to our invasion.  We created conditions which were ideal for an insurgency.  Now we have a lot of people pissed off in the middle east who would not have become terrorists if we had not invaded.    How is fighting an insurgency in Iraq keeping us safe at home?  Islamic terrorists are not the German Army of WWII.  They can choose to fight in Iraq, Afghanistan, Chechnya, France, or anywhere else.  Many terrorists are not controlled by a larger group, and few are controlled by a state.  Many terrorists are self supporting and self generating.  Look at the doctors in the UK a few months ago.  The war in Iraq certainly didn&apos;t stop them from attacking airports.    There have been attempted terrorist attacks in the US since we invaded Iraq.  Good police work and security at home stopped them.  The fact that they were stopped IN THE UNITED STATES shows that there WERE NOT tied down in Iraq. "

Al Qaeda will continue to try and destabilize the Iraqi government and maybe the Middle East after we are gone   that is a threat to our national security.   Then there is the matter of Iran. They are developing a nuclear weapon which is a direct threat to America s national security. We now have military capability on their border. After 12-31-11 we will have none.   If there are national security issues for the United States in Iraq, why should the Iraqis decide?  It is a difficult question, but one that is going to have to be answered as we get closer to 12-31-11.&quot;</u>     If there are national security issues for the United States in Iraq, why should the Iraqis decide?   Because its thier country and they claim they can defend themselves. Who are we to say different? We just cant invade and occupy a nation when someone feels threatened,that would make us agressors. Why dont we just invade and occupy N.Korea? They already have demonstrated they have Nuclear weapons isnt that a threat to our national security?  As far as leaving Iraq, How long did it take to leave VN? Its thier country and they dont want us there so its past time to leave. "

Davis: Saying no to war for sake of peace   Right now the Obama administration is locked in an intense, agonizing debate regarding the course of action to which it will commit the United States in Afghanistan.  At the same time, senior uniformed and civilian leaders are grappling with the deteriorating security situation in Iraq, wondering if we&apos;ll be able to redeploy our combat forces next year as currently planned.  The former could commit over 100,000 U.S. combat troops to Afghanistan for an indeterminate number of years; the latter could leave nearly 120,000 in Iraq for some equally unknown period of time.   The cost of these twin problems to the nation in terms of the escalating numbers of killed and wounded troops, the billions of dollars a month spent to fund them, and the wear and tear on the Force has already been severe and will only get worse with time.   In May of this year, the U.S. Army submitted to Congress its &amp;quot;2009 Posture Statement&amp;quot; that describes the Army&apos;s expectation of perpetual future conflict. &amp;quot;Many national security and intelligence experts,&amp;quot; the statement explains, &amp;quot;share the Army&apos;s assessment that the next several decades will be characterized by persistent conflict -- protracted confrontation among state, non-state, and individual actors...&amp;quot;   But is this a good -- or even valid -- assumption?   Unquestioned in this supposition is that we must and will fight each time presented with a complex international problem that includes violent opponents -- and the option of refusing the conflict won&apos;t be possible or desirable. But to see how faulty that thinking is, consider the two wars we&apos;re fighting today.  In 2003, Saddam was a nuisance; a thorn in our side. But he was clearly contained and incapable of launching any cross-border invasions. Regardless of one&apos;s political persuasion, there was no need to attack Iraq at that time.   Following 9/11, we could have attacked al-Qaeda and defended America&apos;s legitimate vital national interests without invading and occupying &amp;quot;the second poorest country in the world for eight-going-on-forever years.&amp;quot;   We must divest ourselves of the flawed assumption that we must always fight a war in answer to any provocation.   Douglas Macgregor recently wrote an essay in the Armed Forces Journal titled, &amp;quot;Refusing Battle.&amp;quot; He posits that numerous times in our nation&apos;s history we have fought wars when we should have refused battle, and each of those occasions has had disastrous effects for our country.   As of Nov. 2 in both Iraq and Afghanistan, a total of 5,245 service members have lost their lives and a whopping 35,944 have been wounded in action. According to the Congressional Research Service, Congress has thus far approved more than  1 trillion to pay for the wars.  But has the extraordinary hemorrhaging of American blood and treasure -- necessitated by accepting battle in 2001 and 2003 -- made the United States more secure?   Clearly it has not: Prior to choosing combat in those two cases, the U.S. had to contend with no insurgencies and with one main transnational terror threat. Today, the threats are significantly broader, deeper, and more lethal.   For the sake of the tens of thousands of veterans -- and their families -- who have paid such a bitter price for those twin decisions to accept battle, let us with wisdom and a sober spirit commit to using all the tools at our national disposal for solving complex problems in a violent world, and return war to its rightful place as a means of last resort.

It damn sure is.     Your last paragraph does describe victory in Iraq, Boilerman. It is very close to what President Bush said in January 2007 when he came up with another reason of why we were fighting in Iraq:  We&apos;re in Iraq to establish    a free Iraq that is democratic, that can govern itself, defend itself and sustain itself, and be a strong ally in this war against radicals and extremists who would do us harm.

It seems in Vietnam we were &amp;quot;somewhat&amp;quot; successful in that venture.  I suppose &apos;somewhat&apos; is never good enough.  Now we have unmanned predator drones flying over both Afghanistan and Pakistan seeking out to destroy TAL-AQ leadership.  Several of these drone attacks have been successful.  The problem always seems to be &amp;quot;collateral damage.&amp;quot;  Yes, we get the bad guys, &amp;quot;but&amp;quot; in the process, innocent civilians get killed.  Then, the innocent civilians who remain alive who see their family members killed, don&apos;t become so innocent anymore.  So, bingo, TAL-AQ get new recruits even if they don&apos;t need them.  This seems to be &amp;quot;the vicious cycle.&amp;quot;    Your analogy of Rome is a good one.  The Roman Empire was a state founded on militarism and conquest.  On the other hand, the United States of America was not.    I remember on a trip to Germany in 1980, I walked into a restaurant in Dresden.  I suppose my American accent gave me away, as I did not speak German.  To make a long story short, the waiters, the manager, and most of the Germans having lunch literally turned their backs to me, and would not wait on me.  I was simply an American tourist in civilian clothes who wanted to get some lunch.  As I sat down at a table, there was a British gent seated across from me in the very same predicament I was in.  Not being bashful, I asked him what&apos;s going on here?  He replied, well Yank, you do remember the Allied fire bombing of Dresden in WWII that caused the death of thousands of German civilians don&apos;t you?  I replied yes I do, but that was a long time ago.  He then said back to me; time makes no difference, these people have very long memories.  On that note, we both got up and left. "

She said there&apos;s a very easy way to end the war, it&apos;s quite obvious: Stop the flow of arms to foreign fighters.  Stop the flow of foreign fighters across the border.  That&apos;ll end the war in Iraq.  If somebody was looking at this who hadn&apos;t been adequately brainwashed by a good western education, they would collapse in ridicule.  I mean, yes, there are foreign fighters in Iraq and plenty of foreign arms in there namely, from the country that invaded Iraq.  But they&apos;re not foreign, remember.  They&apos;re indigenous because we&apos;re indigenous everywhere.  That follows from owning the world, going back to the infant empire.  It spreads.

But our elected officials that block essential funding are outrageous. We must continue to provide our combat troops with supplies necessary to support them while they are in those combat zones.   If it deficits they are trying to reduce we should look at some of our homeland programs instead.  Maybe its time for the voters to block or reduce their paychecks and the extravagant entertainment budgets. We should put them on the social security program instead of the lavish retirement package they all have  Our Senators and Congressmen don&apos;t pay in to Social Security, and, of course, they don&apos;t collect from it.  The reason is that they have a special retirement plan that they voted for themselves many years ago. For all practical purposes, it works like this:   When they retire, they continue to draw their same pay, until they die, except that it may be increased from time to time, by cost of living adjustments.   For instance, former Senator Bradley, and his wife, may be expected to draw  7,900,000, with Mrs. Bradley drawing  275,000 during the last year of her life.   This is calculated on an average life span for each.   This would be well and good, except that they paid nothing in on any kind of retirement, and neither does any other Senator or Congressman.   This fine retirement comes right out of the General Fund: our tax money.   While we who pay for it all, draw an average of  1000/month from Social Security.   Imagine for a moment that you could structure a retirement plan so desirable that people would have extra deducted so that they could increase their own personal retirement income.   A retirement plan that works so well, that Railroad employees, Postal Workers, and others who aren&apos;t in it, would clamor to get in. That is how good Social Security could be, if only one small change were made.   That change is to jerk the Golden Fleece retirement out from under the Senators and Congressmen, and put them in Social Security with the rest of us. Then watch how fast they fix it.   If enough people receive this, maybe one or some of them along the way, might be able to help. How many can YOU send it to?   link to article  "

Much the same applies with this war as applied with Vietnam.&quot;</u>   I&apos;m not so sure.  There may be some vague similarities comparing war to war and the like, but the circumstances are very different.  For one, it wasn&apos;t a volunteer force that served and died over there.  We will never know whether what you say is true or not, because the engagement was halted by those who didn&apos;t have a dog in the hunt.  Unlike WWII, all of the subsequent significant wars have been stopped prematurely, before the job was finished.  Korea, VietNam, Gulf I, and now it seems Gulf II, will all go down in history as incomplete chapters.  Passing the issues to the next generation.    Then, like now, people who didn&apos;t serve seem to be having a bigger impact than those wearing a uniform.  Influential mom and dad calls their friend the congressman because they don&apos;t like that their little Tommy or Sally is fighting a war.  That part I would consider a similarity.  The fact that there is a growing lack of support for the war in Iraq, is also a similarity.  The geo-political issues and economic factors, not to mention the religious undertones, associated with this war are very different.    So just because there are veterans who served that don&apos;t support this war based on experiences over 30 years ago, doesn&apos;t mean that things are the same.  It just means they don&apos;t agree with it.  Like it or not, we are going to have to deal with the issues we are faced with, and it might as well be now versus later.  Postponing it for someone else won&apos;t make it go away, it is just a postponement of the inevitable.  That&apos;s how it looks from where I sit."

The Americans get a bad rap from our international &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot; and it is not the fault of tourists who make fools of themselves in foreign lands.    When I was in central and south America I was asked time and time again why didn&apos;t we stay loyal to those governments who helped and were friendly to us.  I tried to explain the political situation in the USA allows our policy&apos;s to change every two, four or eight years.  These countries do not understand how a country&apos;s beliefs could support one program or plan and yet turn against it a few years later.   Most of them have had the same beliefs for a thousand years.  In our case we never know from one administration to the next if we will believe in the same thing in five years.  One administration supports only green people who drive yellow cars and the next one thinks that only orange people who drive blue cars are worth saving.  How can anyone trust us?  When in Europe it was obvious to me that among the older generation the effects of WWII are still being felt by them.  They remember the hardships and the deaths caused by the war.  The younger ones do not understand the concept of how the allies got together and defeated Nazi Germany.  The older ones do and still appreciate what the allies did for them.  The younger ones were taught in school that the war was with the Nazis and eventually they were defeated. They weren&apos;t told of how many countries were actually   in the allied coalition.   When they try to understand America&apos;s size and power plus what our contribution was they think we are being  arrogant.   They think we are just bragging.  Remember most of the European countries are smaller than our individual states.   You can drive across Holland in two hours.  Belgium is faster yet and the same with many of them.   This line of thinking is the same today when people who &amp;quot;have not been there&amp;quot; try to understand modern warfare.  We are not involved in a global war as in 1939-1945.  We are in a localized war that was brought about by religious fanatics.  The fanatics attacked the &amp;quot;arrogant giant&amp;quot; and the political leaders within that giant have been raised to think that wars can be settled in a 120 minute movie or within a 60 minute tv show.  Worse yet are the people who play war computer games and think wars like Iraq and Afghanistan will be over in  a few key strokes.  We are in ground combat in rural and urban areas where the enemy and the friendlies all look the same.  As in Nam the front line is all around us.   Unlike WWII we can not start bombing at one place and continue until you run out of targets.  Withdrawing or known by the more common name of &amp;quot;CUT AND RUN&amp;quot; won&apos;t work in this one.  We are in for the long run.  Look at Korea.  We have been there for 57 years.

Last month (October 2007) Congress passed and President Bush signed into law an increase in the government&apos;s borrowing ceiling to  9.815 trillion.   It was the fifth debt limit increase since Bush took office in January 2001. Those increases have totaled  3.865 trillion. Evidently, paying for the war and other expenses with debt while cutting taxes and telling Americans to go shopping to improve the economy is sound  fiscal logic for this Republican Administration. .    The war in Afghanistan and Iraq are being paid with debt. While war in Afghanistan is deemed necessary, the war in Iraq is one of choice, which has now cost over  600 billion and growing at a rate of  12 billion a month.   Democratic Senate Majority Leader, Harry Reid, says the United States cannot afford the cost. Republican Senate Minority Leader, Mitch McConnell, says the Republicans make no apology for the war in Iraq because it makes Americans safer, but he makes no comment about the cost. No wonder Americans have given this Congress a low ball job approval rating of 11 percent.    Lieutenant General Ray Odierno, CG Multinational Corps - Iraq - reported last week the U.S. military forces have completed their mission providing security for Iraq but because the Iraqi government has failed to form a government of reconciliation, it may be necessary to rethink our strategy if the situation has not improved by summer 2008.    US ground forces after nearly five years of combat literally holding the fort to give the Iraqis security and time to form a government of reconciliation are on a fool&apos;s errand. It is never going to  happen simply because of centuries of animus existing between tribal factions in Iraq. Prominent Iraqi officials have publicly stated as much.     Nevertheless, President Bush will continue  vetoing any war spending bill Democrats send him which include provisions for troop withdrawal, and enough loyal Republicans, literally thumbing their collective noses at the nearly 70 percent of Americans who want the war ended in Iraq, will refuse to join in a vote to override his veto .  Consequently, as long as we have troops physically situated in Iraq Democrats will acquiesce to  the President&apos;s supplemental budget requests for billions of dollars to pay for war, and taxpayers will remain blissfully oblivious of the continual  increase in the nation&apos;s debt, which will become a problem for their children and grand kids.

McNamara and Rumsfeld...two of the same mold. The one big thing that has no simularity is the war itself. Up till Irag and Afganistan our wars have always been political ones. Kings, queens, dictators and unelected leaders who governed by absolute political power. This war is a religious war. If you go back through history religious wars never end. They might subside now and then but there is always the rebirth. The american way of life was built on the Bill of Rights and included is the Freedom of Religion and it&apos;s this freedom that is making this war difficult because we can&apos;t put ourselves in their shoes. We are and have never been religious fanatics nor have we dominated other religions by war, supression and fear. It was one thing going in and destroying Saddam but we had no training or experience dealing with religious fanatics. This is where we have fell short. The goal is to bring Democracy to the region. Democracy and more than one worshipping religion in the Muslim world will never work. This conflict is just another episode in history and the middle east unrest that has existed hundreds of years before the states were even colonies. Today, Vietnam is a stable country, even under communist doctrine but it is liberal considering North Korea. For the first time in their history they are at peace.

The Americans get a bad rap from our international &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot; and it is not the fault of tourists who make fools of themselves in foreign lands.    When I was in central and south America I was asked time and time again why didn&apos;t we stay loyal to those governments who helped and were friendly to us.  I tried to explain the political situation in the USA allows our policy&apos;s to change every two, four or eight years.  These countries do not understand how a country&apos;s beliefs could support one program or plan and yet turn against it a few years later.   Most of them have had the same beliefs for a thousand years.  In our case we never know from one administration to the next if we will believe in the same thing in five years.  One administration supports only green people who drive yellow cars and the next one thinks that only orange people who drive blue cars are worth saving.  How can anyone trust us?  When in Europe it was obvious to me that among the older generation the effects of WWII are still being felt by them.  They remember the hardships and the deaths caused by the war.  The younger ones do not understand the concept of how the allies got together and defeated Nazi Germany.  The older ones do and still appreciate what the allies did for them.  The younger ones were taught in school that the war was with the Nazis and eventually they were defeated. They weren&apos;t told of how many countries were actually   in the allied coalition.   When they try to understand America&apos;s size and power plus what our contribution was they think we are being  arrogant.   They think we are just bragging.  Remember most of the European countries are smaller than our individual states.   You can drive across Holland in two hours.  Belgium is faster yet and the same with many of them.   This line of thinking is the same today when people who &amp;quot;have not been there&amp;quot; try to understand modern warfare.  We are not involved in a global war as in 1939-1945.  We are in a localized war that was brought about by religious fanatics.  The fanatics attacked the &amp;quot;arrogant giant&amp;quot; and the political leaders within that giant have been raised to think that wars can be settled in a 120 minute movie or within a 60 minute tv show.  Worse yet are the people who play war computer games and think wars like Iraq and Afghanistan will be over in  a few key strokes.  We are in ground combat in rural and urban areas where the enemy and the friendlies all look the same.  As in Nam the front line is all around us.   Unlike WWII we can not start bombing at one place and continue until you run out of targets.  Withdrawing or known by the more common name of &amp;quot;CUT AND RUN&amp;quot; won&apos;t work in this one.  We are in for the long run.  Look at Korea.  We have been there for 57 years.

You could have been in debt up to your ears, credit card purchases of the clothing on your back as well as gas in your car they still wanted you to beleive you were rich.  So, think for yourself, if you follow the party propagandizing the scare of debt, these folks have been doing it for generations, it&apos;s the American way. Much of it is largely to do with those that are delivering the message, the earmarkers, the spenders.  Damn if the wife was in debt and wanted me to pay off her bills I surely wouldn&apos;t give her more of my money to spend I&apos;d first take her credit cards.

Back to Story - Help Could U.S. military gains in Iraq outlast Bush? By David Morgan 2 hours, 20 minutes ago     With an intensifying White House race drawing attention to his legacy, President George W. Bush could leave office without the baggage of complete failure in Iraq thanks to new U.S. military gains, some analysts say.  American success at quelling sectarian and insurgent violence has raised hopes that the relatively calmer conditions of the past few months in Iraq might last into early 2009, when the next U.S. president takes over.  &amp;quot;The overall prediction has to be that George Bush will escape this without an obviously visible abject failure. It may become that again over time. But right now, it looks like Bush will escape by the skin of his teeth,&amp;quot; said Michael O&apos;Hanlon of the Brookings Institution.  O&apos;Hanlon, who drew attention last July when he expressed optimism about the U.S. mission in Iraq in a New York Times column, estimates the odds of a major deterioration during Bush&apos;s remaining 14 months in office at less than 50 percent.  Bush&apos;s so-called surge strategy, which placed an extra 30,000 troops in Iraq this year to stabilize Baghdad and its environs, has contributed to a steep decline in violence the past two months, statistics released in recent weeks show.  Violence has fluctuated widely since the 2003 U.S. invasion. But analysts say recent improvements may continue because of more effective U.S. tactics and a rebellion against al Qaeda in Iraq by Sunni leaders in Anbar province.  Roadside bombing incidents have fallen by more than half since March. U.S. military deaths in October were at their lowest level since March 2006, and Iraqi civilian deaths were down about two-thirds from a 2007 high in January.  O&apos;Hanlon said he believed the less violent conditions are likely to endure until Bush leaves office, despite the planned withdrawal of 20,000 U.S. combat troops by next July. "

He has received evert penny he has asked for. NOBODY has questioned the fail strategies, or the inability to adjust and tailor those strategies to the situation on the ground. NOBODY has held him, his staff, the Joint Chiefs, and the brass at the pentagon or the general officers in the field accountable.  The failure of leadership and accountability is what is impeding success. I am not standing up for the Democrats in congress, or the Republicans.

Noone has stood in his way??  Too funny.  Why should we do that, exactly?  We the people elected him.  We pay him to work with Congress, who spends the money, and the Supreme Court, who keeps everyone in line.  So who exactly is supposed to stand in his way?  You honestly believe that nobody questions what&apos;s going on?  There at least ten people I can think of who would love to replace him in the White House.  You think they are going to do a better job?  With the same couple of million government employees working for them, give or take a few political appointees?  I call that pretty darn naive myself.  I also believe it to be extremely naive to think that there is no plan for what&apos;s going on.  I would bet money that there are dozens of plans for varying situations, any of which would be instituted when appropriate.  Does that mean that any of them would work?  Nope.  No plan is fullproof and therefore not pivotal in the big scheme of things.  Plans change all the time, as do strategies and tactics.  It&apos;s the ability to adjust to adversity that guarantees success.  I have the utmost faith in GEN Patraeus&apos;s ability to adjust to things on the ground.  But none of that will matter if we give up on our leadership and turn our backs on what&apos;s going on.  We must stand together, or we all fall.  And finally, how do you demand victory?  How does that work, exactly?  I always thought that victory was achieved through perserverance and tenacity, not by giving up.  Now maybe that&apos;s not what you&apos;re suggesting, but it sure sounds like it to me.  I think it&apos;s foolish to think that any of this will be over any time soon.  I&apos;ve never felt that way, just because of the nature of what we&apos;re dealing with.  And it certainly won&apos;t get fixed if we cut and run.  Like it or not, we&apos;re in this for the long haul.  Even if we stop now, we&apos;ll be forced to reengage at some point in the future, so why not finish it now?  Of course, I could be totally full of it, and absolutely wrong on all counts, but I kinda doubt it.  My gut tells me that things are gonna get worse before they get better.

The cost of the surge can be measured in the high numbers of killed and wounded. But it has placed us in a position for the fist time in 4 years to possibly grasp victory again.   As far as demanding victory, we have an obligation as citizens and taxpayers (especially those of us that have served)to demand successful leadership for our troops at all levels. Failure to provide adequate successful leadership we also have an obligation to pull our troop out of the line of battle.   Perseverance and tenacity are provided daily by our solders on the ground. There is no shortage there. However, over the last five years several political appointees and General officers have failed to get the job done or in some cases made the situation worse. None have been held accountable or were removed while serving.  We have no choice but to have faith in Patreaus. I met him in &apos;03 and he certainly is impressive. He however cannot win this war alone. Both the Iraqi government and OUR government are increasingly failing to do what is necessary to succeed.  President Bush has had 5 years of blank checks and unhindered operational control in Iraq and he has failed. The surge strategy is a direct result of political pressure from both Republicans and Democrats for a change in direction. This is no time to ease up on that pressure.  The Dems and Republicans in congress can waste time polarizing over this issue and accomplish nothing. But, We must never fail to hold them and the president accountable for failed leadership while we have troops dying in combat.  I have never said cut and run, and don&apos;t intend to. But, to continue to fund this war without restraint is pure idiocy. Money and votes are the only leverage that we have to hold their feet to the fire. "

Any laws passed, any money spent, is all on their shoulders.  We elect them to represent us.  Whether they do that effectively or not will determine their future (hopefully) in that organization.    The one thing that bothers me about what you repeatedly say is that nothing is being done.  Noone has been relieved.  There have been no changes in government.  Right off the top of my head I can think of several political appointees and senior staff members who are different than the ones GWB started out with 7 years ago.  Same thing for the military.  Maybe things would have been different if GEN Patraeus would have been in command early on.  I knew him when he was a Major, and I too was impressed.  Who knows?  Doesn&apos;t really matter because what&apos;s done is done.  All I&apos;m trying to point out is that we have a system, and a good one at that.  It does work, IF you let it work.  If any one of us here on these boards could do a better job, why the hell didn&apos;t we make different choices during our careers and put ourselves in the position to do so?  Hindsight is an amazing thing.  It&apos;s makes us all look like we&apos;re a genius.  Problem is, it&apos;s not reality.  It&apos;s a fantasy world of our own devices.  And of course, it&apos;s always going to be perfect.  Maybe I have a little more faith than others here.  I don&apos;t know.  I&apos;ve met alot of people out there in my travels, in the positions I&apos;ve held, and have had occasion to meet some pretty amazing people.  Some of those people are in the trenches right now, both in Iraq and Washington D.C.  I would like to think that my perception of them was correct, and that they will continue to provide the outstanding leadership they did when I worked with them.  Then again, maybe it&apos;s not in their power to change things.  But we will probably never know the answer to that.  I&apos;m retired now in California, and I have no idea where you are.

In you cited cases we defeated the standing military force of a declared enemy, which in turn lead to unconditional surrender of the legitimate government of the time.  Taint gonna happen in this case.  There is no &amp;quot;army&amp;quot; to defeat, and the government is one of our choosing.  The only reason why your examples were able to quickly recover was due to the Marshall Plan, a plan that many military and civilian leaders vehemently opposed.  The cost of the plan was repaid to us.  The President and his advisors evidently are unaware that Korea, Japan, and Germany were prostrate and in total ruin when the occupation forces took over.  The few hard core survivors of the old regimes who attempted to rebel were quickly rounded up and eliminated.  There was little to no danger to the occupying forces.    In your and the Administration s grand scheme, the occupying forces (for that is what they are) would not have any more security than they do today, and would continue to take casualties.  As there is no army to defeat, there would be no  victory , just a continuation of the violence.  And, do you really think that the population would just be overjoyed to have us occupying their space, even if it were just the fortified compounds that would be necessary to ensure some sort of safety for our troops?

He and many other Sunni Muslims in Iraq shunned elections and fought instead with roadside bombs and rocket-propelled grenades.  With provincial elections scheduled for autumn, however, Nadhim and other Sunnis say they made a mistake by sitting out the elections in January 2005.

Despite the best efforts of the Administration, the Iranians are still working on nuclear capability.   Hezbollah has more seats in the Lebanese Parliament than when W. became President and fought Israel to a standstill in 2006. With backing from Syria, they are now a more dominate factor in Lebanon.   Hamas was elected to lead the Palestinian people on W. s watch and now controls the Gaza strip. They had never officially controlled anything before.   Syria withdrew security forces from Lebanon, but still has great influence in that country s politics and continues to supply Hezbollah, including rockets that are fired into Israel and to assassinate Lebanese leaders.   North Korea continues to d!ck us around, promising to give up their nukes, but they have not, although we have started to give them food and fuel oil again.   Afghanistan is struggling to maintain its gains. President Karzai has control of the capitol Kabul, but not much else. Despite the best efforts of NATO forces, the Taliban is still a threat to the country. Afghanistan supplies more than 70  of the world s heroin, which in turn supplies the Taliban and al Qaeda with money to further terrorism.   President Bush has lost ground on the war on drugs also, with Afghanistan leading the way in supplying the world with heroin and porous southern border where drugs still stream in from Mexico.  Shia Militias are as strong as ever and some continue to kill Americans and Iraqi officials.  Many Sunni have joined forces with American forces and fight against al Qaeda. Many do not and still kill Americans and ISF. Some play both sides of the fence, they kill al Qaeda and Americans.  Al Qaeda in Iraq   American forces have done an outstanding job in going after al Qaeda in Iraq. But they are still a force to be reckoned with, one that did not exist before the invasion of Iraq.   Al Qaeda was crippled after the U.S. drove them out of Afghanistan. However they are now reconstituting and now have safe bases in Pakistan from which to plan and train for the next large scale attack on America.

Just like now I confirm that stats were not kept on deaths occuring directly linked to the occupation of Germany. Fact of the matter the current administration has finally got around to agreeing to issue service ribbons on European Cold War participation. Purple hearts were issued for the time period in question but here again if they were for the narrow window of west Germany occupation I can&apos;t say. Also, to follow up on one point, thirty one lives were lost in the Berlin airlift. The last death in Europe &amp;quot;cold war&amp;quot; was 1985.   All this has been described as the &amp;quot;Bloodless war&amp;quot; but in my little sphere I recounted 28 lives lost contributing to hostile enviroment. They (government)are finally accumlating stats even to the extent of asking vets of the time period to submit information to the DOD. On the larger scale the cold war 1945-1991 cost 8 trillion dolalrs and millions of European lives, either in starvation, displacements or retribution to Germans.    Along with, 100,000 plus military deaths in Nam and Korea the cold war was anything but cold.     THE CASE FOR A EUROPE DEFENSE SERVICE MEDAL                      Military actions in United States Military history have resulted in the US Government creating a military award for the defense of the particular theater or portion of the globe in which the action occurred.  This has not been done in the case of the successful defense of Europe during the Cold War 1945-91, through an apparent oversight, probably because the end of the Cold War in Europe occurred about the same time as the Persian Gulf War was fought.  Misinterpreted by some as simply a period of peace, the Cold War in Europe was the longest war in our nation&apos;s history.  Individual men and women of the  US Military were stationed, deployed, and involved within the European continent and theater of operations.  Yet no recognition has been received for their service.  Now is the time for our nation to recognize the efforts of those individuals for their service overseas.  The last US Military death in the Cold War in Europe was US Army Major Arthur D. Nicholson, killed by a Soviet soldier in 1985.  Many others were killed, wounded or lost before him in a war fought by about 5 Million US-NATO Allied Military Forces to prevent Soviet Union-Warsaw Pact Military Forces from invading Western Europe.  For example, there are cases of US aircraft and their crews being shot down across Eastern European borders.  Also, US Military personnel were subject to terrorist actions from the Marxist Red Army Faction and similar organizations.  Then on the front, and on the northern and southern flanks, border clashes and hostile encounters with opposing forces occurred.  All service in Cold War Europe was not combative, as in other theaters of operations where campaign medals have been awarded..  But in the preparation for combat, standing guard, and manning outposts on traditional invasion routes into Europe from the East along the borders of the Soviet States, and other areas, many US Military personnel suffered and endured in the cold and heat in silence while separated from their families, friends and loved ones.  Many remember the alerts, not knowing if it were the real event for which they had trained.  However, they stood their posts ready to fulfill their responsibility to protect Europe, recognizing that if it were the &amp;quot;Real Thing,&amp;quot; they were to serve and fight, to be a &amp;quot;speed bump,&amp;quot; to slow down the Soviet-Warsaw Pact Divisions until additional help could arrive to repel the invaders.  US President Dwight D. Eisenhower recognized the importance of the Cold War in Europe when he stated, &amp;quot;There is but one way to avoid Total War - that is to win the Cold War.&amp;quot;  The Cold War in Europe was won by US-NATO Allied Military Forces on December 25, 1991, when the USSR-Warsaw Pact collapsed and ceased to exist.  Now is the time to belatedly recognize the solid and honest efforts of those quiet US Cold Warriors who &amp;quot;Made it Happen&amp;quot; in Europe  http://www.edva.us/page3.html  "

I think not.  Regardless of your experiences, it gives you no right to characterize service members that way and as a senior WO I would expect a bit more.  And, I suggest that your 1965 figure IS WAY OFF.  Why?  Because I trained extensively with forces that were to react to a Soviet invasion of Western Europe and we did not stand down that posture until well into the eighties.  We had equipment and materials stock-piled in theater specifically for that purpose.  So please stop with your revisionism of why our forces are in Europe today so it fits your anti-Iraq war ideology.   The reason we are in Germany today is the same reason our forces must stay in the M.E. for sometime to come.&quot;</u>  I did not say all deaths were due to alcohol or suicide, although there were a significant number of both.  That would be as ludicrous as your contention. Death by automobile, training accidents, homicides, suicides, natural causes, would occur no matter where the military was stationed.  As for  no right , that is your personal opinion.  I give due where due is required.  I also am a realist and do not try to look through rose glasses or try to be PC.   A numb nut is a numb nut, no matter how you may try and dress it.  A pig with lipstick is a pig with lipstick.  Another little story about a numb nut.  Ft. Campbell, 1978.  A young GI, married with a small child, gets rip roaring drunk, climbs up a telephone pole onto a platform between another pole.  Platform contains high voltage transformers. GI grasps a hold of a transformer, and dances for approx 20 minutes until power can be shut off.  Needless to say he is dead.  I had the unpleasant task of conducting a Line of Duty Investigation into this affair. A very difficult and disheartening task, as part of the investigation required that I interview the widow. There were several ways I could have gone with the available evidence; Not in Line of Duty, which meant that the widow would receive no benefits, or Line of Duty. In the end, I went through the DISCOM commander to MG John Wickham, Division Commander. We discussed the case, and my finding was for Line of Duty.  It could have gone the other way if I had not cared.  Why punish the widow for her husband s reckless and stupid actions? Now, did he die as a defender of the nation?  All but in the end and that is what counted.  His last actions.   And you bought into the monolithic communist block theory!  Also, as a defender and participant of the &amp;quot;Fulda Gap Defense&amp;quot; you should be thankful that it was never utilized.  Perhaps it escaped your attention that each and every one of our &amp;quot;4102&amp;quot; super secret going to war plans were in the hands of the opposition before everyone had a chance to finish all the annexes.  Ever hear of SFC Conrad?  Your self named moniker  Lucky  actually does apply.  Lucky you never had to implement a compromised war plan.  So, I picked the date out of the air, but so did you as the reason why we have stayed so long there. It was more a matter of US interest and fighting the cold war on someone else s turf than any of the anti-invasion malarkey.   The Sovs and the rest of the pack were fairly hollow.  They had a lot of manpower, but the majority of the equipment was inferior to ours.  No, the guy who hung himself in his locker (mighty small and cramped space to accomplish this); the guys who OD on a cocktail of hash laced with heroin, smoked in a houka with Night Train instead of water, then drank the concoction; the guys mentioned above; all were numb nuts.  The people I had empathy for were the survivors; the widows, children and parents. These jerks put them through hell for their own selfish interests.  So, LLT, I paid my dues, and tried to help those who needed and asked for help, went way out on a limb for those I thought had potential and could be helped, and did my duty.  I even mentored many junior officers.  But all that is history, and I do not need some snot nosed LT telling me he is disappointed in me. Be disappointed!! "

Every death I inumarated above is listed as &amp;quot;Killed in Action&amp;quot;, which clearly indicates they were killed before they even reached an aid station.  I was in fact being very conservative - there were 171 Battle Deaths in the month of June alone.  All that differentiats those 171 Battle Deaths from the &amp;quot;Killed in Action&amp;quot; deaths was that those battle deaths at least got to an Aid Station alive.  However, we can not rule out that such deaths occured many days, weeks or months after the injury was sustained, so we can not include them in the total count of deaths after the end of the war.

barack_obamba_and_his_presidency,409192893_5910090302001,30,backtoiraq,Sun 19 October 2008 06:57 PM,"Around 1979 Obama started college at Occidental in California.. He is very open about his two years at Occidental, he tried all kinds of drugs and was wasting his time but, even though he had a brilliant mind, did not apply himself to his studies. &apos;Barry&apos; (that was the name he used all his life) during this time had two roommates, Muhammad Hasen Chandoo and Wahid Hamid, both from Pakistan . During the summer of 1981, after his second year of college, he made a &apos;round the world&apos; trip. He stopped to see his mother in Indonesia , next to Hyderabad in India , three weeks in Karachi , Pakistan where he stayed with his room mate&apos;s family, then off to Africa to visit his father&apos;s family. My question - Where did he get the money for this trip?!? When he came back he started school at Columbia University in New York . It is at this time he wanted everyone to call him Barack - not Barry. Do you know what the tuition is at Columbia ? It&apos;s not cheap! to say the least. Where did he get money for tuition?!? Student Loans? Maybe. After Columbia , he went to Chicago to work as a Community Organizer for a mere  12,000 a year. Why Chicago? Why not New York ? He was already living in New York. By &apos;chance&apos; he met Antoin &apos;Tony&apos; Rezko, born in Aleppo , Syria , and a real estate developer in Chicago . Rezko has been convicted of fraud and bribery this year. Rezko, was named &apos;Entrepreneur of the Decade&apos; by theArab-American Business and Professional Association&apos;. About two years later, Obama entered Harvard Law School . Do you have any idea what tuition is for Harvard Law School ?? Where did he get the money for LawSchool?!? More student loans? After Law school, he went back to Chicago . Rezko offered him a job, which he turned down. But, he did take a job with Davis, Miner , Barnhill &amp; Galland. Guess what? They represented &apos;Rezar&apos; which is Rezko&apos;s firm. Rezko was one of Obama&apos;s first major financial contributors when he ran for office in Chicago . In 2003, Rezko threw an early fundraiser for Obama which Chicago Tribune reporter David Mendelland claims was instrumental in providing Obama with &apos;seed money&apos; for his U.S. Senate race. In 2005, Obama purchased a new home in Kenwood District of Chicago for  1.65 million(less than asking price). With ALL those Student Loans - Where did he get the money for the property?!? On that same day Rezko&apos;s wife, Rita, purchased the adjoining empty lot for full price. The London Times reported that Nadhmi Auchi, an Iraqi-born billionaire, loaned Rezko  3.5million 3 weeks before Obama&apos;s home was purchased. Obama met NadhmiAuchi many times with Rezko. Now, we have Obama running for President. Valerie Jarrett, was Michele Obama&apos;s boss. She is now Obama&apos;s chief advisor and he does not make any major decisions without talking to her first. Where was Jarrett born?? Ready for this? Shiraz, Iran! Do we see a pattern here? Or am I going crazy? On May 10, 2008 The Times reported, Robert Malley, advisor to Obama was&apos; sacked&apos; (fired)after the press found out he was having regular contacts with &apos;Hamas&apos;, which controls Gaza and is connected with Iran. This past week, buried in the back part of the papers, Iraqi newspapers reported that during Obama&apos;s visit to Iraq, he asked their leaders to do nothing about the war until after he is elected, and he will &apos;Take care of things&apos;. Oh, and by the way, remember the college roommates that where born in Pakistan ? They are in charge of all those &apos;small&apos; Internet campaign contribution for Obama. Where is that money coming from?!? The poor and middle class in this country? Or could it be from the Middle East? And the final bit of news. On September 7, 2008, The Washington Times posted a verbal slip that was made on &apos;This Week&apos; with George Stephanapoulos. Obama on talking about his religion said, &apos;My Muslim faith&apos;. When questioned, &apos;he make a mistake&apos;. Some mistake! All of the above information I got on line. If you would like to check it - encyclopedia, Barack Obama; Tony Rezko; Valerie Jarrett: Daily Times - Obama visited Pakistan in 1981; The Washington Times - September7, 2008; The Times May 10, 2008. Please do your own homework on this man. The very survival of this great country depends on it. Now the BIG question - If I found out all this information on my own, Why haven&apos;t all of our &apos;intelligent&apos; members of the press been reporting this? A phrase that keeps ringing in my ear - &apos;Beware of the enemy from within&apos;!!! Are we, American citizens, this stupid to vote for a person with this kind of back ground? "

MSNBC is practically one giant infomercial PRO-OBAMA and very, very, ANTI-McCAIN   Christ Matthews is anti-republican   PRO-Obama  - so the entire time MSNBC is on 24/7 it is ripping apart McCain and calling Palin every simple-minded name in the book   non-stop!  They ve disgraced Tim Russert! Watch Keith Olbermann for 5-10 minutes and it is nothing but anti-McCain   worship blessed Obama   the entire time !  Then he ends and Rachael Maddow comes on for an another hour   and she s the host for Airhead Amerikka  So, they have 1-2 hrs of Matthews spewing anti-republican McCain lost verbage... An hour of Olbermann practically having a break-down each show spewing anti-McCain venom, then Maddow spewing the same hatred - back to another repeated hr of Olberman after Maddow - EVERY FREAKING NIGHT!  CNN   can t imagine is much different     Ask people if they would vote for Obama, if he were a socialist?    Obama s adopted grandfather was a  Community Organizer   He was also an activist member of the Communists USA in Hawaii.  Obama claims this man had a great influence in his life.  Obama seeks out and finds a church teaching Liberation Theology.  The doctrines of Trinity Church of Christ are based upon Liberation Theology.  Rev. Wright  was  at one a member of the Nation of Islam.  The Nation of Islam is essentially just another church teaching Liberation Theology with a different religious flavoring sprinkled throughout.   Liberation Theology is Marist/Leninist   Communism   with religious overtones to reach religious people in churches.  Look it up   that s all it is  communism wrapped in a religious vocabulary   Obama s connection to Ayers is because of their COMMON WORLDVIEWS   BOTH hold strong communist   socialist views.  Ayers HATES America   says so many times.  He and his wife Dohrn, HATE AmeriKKKA (her spelling) and have made it their life s ambition to TEAR IT DOWN   destroy America and ALL Capitalism   Free Enterprise!!!  Obama worked for the same law firm as Dohrn!    Obama helps finance   teach   hold seminars   and organize &amp; promote Ayers  radical ANTI-AMERICAN education, which no one seems to ever question.  Ayers hires a fellow communist Michael Klonsky to help promote some of Ayers  radical anti-American education   Obama even helps finance the program direction with Klonsky.  Klonsky was on Obama s 2008 campaign as the Educational advisory   Klonsky is the Co-FOUNDER of the, guess - COMMUNIST USA!  What s the COMMON THREAD   Communism   All throughout Obama s LIFE it is the single most consistent aspect   COMMUNISM!    Why was all this hidden from the American people all this time  because the FILES that contained the information were LOCKED UP!  The Chicago Library actually CLOSED DOWN THE ENTIRE SECTION OF THE LIBRARY until only a few weeks ago.  There are many other files in there people are trying to access.  However, during all that time   no one really knows what was removed   or reworked and replaced in those files.  Just like Obama s Thesis that has NEVER been released  where is that?  When Obama was in college he was a disciple of Edward Said   look that guy up once   PLO advocate hated Israel     Muravchik quotes Obama s own words about his selection of associates, and points out that to Obama and his colleagues and mentors, the term  community organizer  was a euphemism for professional radical!    . . .to avoid being mistaken for a sellout, I chose my friends carefully. The more politically active black students. The foreign students. The Chicanos. The Marxist professors and structural feminists and punk-rock performance poets . . .&amp;quot;  So, the  Community Organizer  is nothing more than a Barack s way of saying he was and is a socialist/communist and still actively believes in the cause     Is it legitimate to question   damn right   will it matter   NOT NOW   no one believes it and they refuse to believe it because 90  media bows and worships at his feet.  Why, because HE is the closest they ve come to ever gaining a permanent stronghold over the basic beliefs of the American people.  When they tried with Air-America to reach out   they learned that most American s do not support their arrogant liberal bs   So, while all eyes are on the war   and democrats keep stalling and stalling   the economic situation keeps brewing.  Congress is warned   repeatedly   over and over   if something is not done economic meltdown will occur   The democrats bulk   and refuse the vote even to come out on the floor   all the while everyone is hearing the democrats scream about Abu Garb   Gitmo   Torture   impeach Bush  yada yada  tic tic tic   now   4-5 weeks out from the final election   yep    When was the last time you heard about Abu Garb   Gitmo   Torture   etc ?  When was the last time we heard one of the democrats complain about Iraq   yep   everyone is preoccupied with the economy   Barney Franks boyfriend was at the center of Fannie Mae   creating the exact loans that ACORN was pressuring congress to mandate  Conflict of Interest???

For all you know YOU might agree with what the author was saying IN THIS BOOK or with Obama&apos;s comment about it. Ayers is/was a scumbag but he isn&apos;t stupid.    quote:  From Library Journal Headlines regularly depict juvenile criminals as extreme and violent &amp;quot;superpredators&amp;quot;?a distorted and incomplete picture that shapes the way Americans think and feel about poor (and mostly minority) city kids. For five years, Ayers, a former member of the radical 1960s Weathermen organization, acted as a teacher and an observer in Chicago&apos;s Juvenile Court prison, the nation&apos;s first?and largest?institution of juvenile justice. Founded by the legendary Jane Addams to act as a &amp;quot;kind and just parent&amp;quot; for children in need, the court today epitomizes the confused and confusing way American justice deals with children. In Ayers&apos;s book, an account of one year in his classroom there, students describe their lives, analyze their situations, and think about their futures. Like Jonathan Kozol in Amazing Grace (LJ 10/1/95), Ayers shows that we must overcome our preconceived notions of these children and learn to deal with the realities of their lives. Ayers is a born educator and communicator, with a voice of hope. Recommended for general collections.?Sandra K. Lindheimer, Middlesex Law Lib., Cambridge, Mass.

Bills Ayers gives interview:  How do you feel about what you did?  Would you do it again under similar circumstances?  He replied:[24]  I ve thought about this a lot. Being almost 60, it s impossible to not have lots and lots of regrets about lots and lots of things, but the question of did we do something that was horrendous, awful?   I don t think so.  I think what we did was to respond to a situation that was unconscionable.    2005   Barack is sworn in as U.S. Senator.   Michelle Obama is promoted to Vice President of Community and External Affairs where she still works part-time.   2006  Barack traveled to Kenya and openly campaigned for violent radical Muslim Raila Odinga, Barack s alleged cousin.  Bill Ayers travels to Venezuela and gives a speech to Hugo Chavez, stating  We share the belief that education is the motor-force of revolution  or  La educacion es revolucion! .   2007  February Barack announces he will run for President.  One other nugget   Ayers hires a guy named Michael Klonsky to head up one his radical educational programs.  Michael Klonsky happens to be a Co-Founder of the Communist USA and other radical communist groups in the US.  Obama hires Klonsky to be his Educational Advisor on his 2008 Presidential Campaign   Do you see any common thread through there yet..?  Did they all happen to just be in the same places at the same time   You don t think Klonsky knew Barack &amp; Ayers were friends that was just a conincidence ?     a few minutes out of HUNDREDS of hours of the Rev. Wright&apos;s sermons were taken out of context. BFD   Personally, I tend to agree   they were most likely yanked out of context.  If for no other context, the man was speaking to  his  congregation, which is black, in a style that was probably jaw-dropping to most average  white-folks.   Those clips didn t really rock my boat   good bad or whatever   oh well   I don t really care about Wright s teachings   HOWEVER   it is HIS teachings that influenced Obama and convinced him to remain at Trinity church.  Technically, Wright holds the doctrine of  Black Liberation Theology.   Again, however, I think the  black  aspect only confuses the issue.  Liberation Theology is ANTI-AMERICAN   period.  It is Marxist   Communism.  That s all it is with a few sprinkles of Christian clich s wrapped in leather bound bible-speak.  It is highly disputed as even Christian even among black church leaders  again though that isn t my concern   The POINT is - THAT was the teaching that attracted Barack Obama   which he claims in his own book   dedicated to his pastor &amp; spiritual mentor   Barack states that he was  looking  for that type of teaching   Wright was a member of the Nation of Islam.  Don t know why he left   don t care   kind-a glad he did but he apparently LIKED the teachings because he retained the Liberation aspect!  Louis Farrakhan teaches the same garbage   Liberation Theology with a  Muslim  twist as opposed to Wright s supposed Christian twist.  BOTH are equally anti-American communist based doctrines.  Both are filled arrogant beliefs but most importantly they are communist based.  Wright s theology is based upon James Hal Cone.  I ve checked out the Trinity Church s website   I didn t see anything alarmingly crazy.  Obama&apos;s respect for Wright was enough that he sought the Reverend&apos;s counsel before formally declaring his candidacy for U.S. President   good for Barack, I don t hold that against him at all. Moreover, Obama and his wife selected Wright to perform their wedding ceremony and to baptize their two daughters.    Apart from America&apos;s purported racism, Wright also despises the nation&apos;s capitalist economic structure, viewing it as a breeding ground for all manner of injustice. &amp;quot;Capitalism as made manifest in the &apos;New World,&apos;&amp;quot; says Wright, &amp;quot;depended upon slave labor (by African slaves), and it is only maintained by keeping the &apos;Two-Thirds World&apos; under oppression.&amp;quot;[7] This anti-capitalist perspective is further reflected in TUCC&apos;s &amp;quot;10-point vision,&amp;quot; whose ideals include the cultivation of &amp;quot;a congregation working towards ECONOMIC PARITY.&amp;quot; Dispelling any doubt that this is a reference to socialism and the wholesale redistribution of wealth, the TUCC mission statement plainly declares its goal of helping &amp;quot;the less fortunate to become agents of change for God who is not pleased with America&apos;s economic mal-distribution!&amp;quot;  This view is entirely consistent with Rev. Wright&apos;s devotion to the tenets of liberation theology, which is essentially Marxism dressed up as Christianity.  Devised by Cold War-era theologians, it teaches that the gospels of Jesus can be understood only as calls for social activism, class struggle, and revolution aimed at overturning the existing capitalist order and installing, in its stead, a socialist utopia where today&apos;s poor will unseat their &amp;quot;oppressors&amp;quot; and become liberated from their material (and, consequently, their spiritual) deprivations. An extension of this paradigm is black liberation theology, which seeks to foment a similar Marxist revolutionary fervor founded on racial rather than class solidarity. Wright&apos;s mentor in this discipline is James Cone, author of the landmark text Black Power and Black Theology. Arguing that Christianity has been used by white society as an opiate of the (black) masses, Cone asserts that the destitute &amp;quot;are made and kept poor by the rich and powerful few,&amp;quot; and that &amp;quot;[n]o one can be a follower of Jesus Christ without a political commitment that expresses one&apos;s solidarity with victims.&amp;quot;  So   again   the connections are consistent   Obama was influenced by his communist supporting, community leader &amp; activist grandfather.  That influence carried into his adulthood and is NOW prevalent within his own ideology.  Obama is without a doubt a socialist at best or a communist.  The issue is his LYING and SCHEMING   the audacity of arrogance to NOT level with the American People and simply state plainly what he is   where he comes from   what he believes   He knows damn-well Liberation Theology is NOT typical American Christianity   it is NOT even typical Black American Christianity.      Obama was on the board of a group that funded local activities that MET DEFINED STANDARDS. A group, Ayers supported met those standards and got funding. BFD  I think this is answer fairly well in the above chronology  and there is much more under the radar that hasn t come out yet     So, lying NOPE   NOTTA   it s all there   refute what can but there is much more than that floating around.  Gullible   NOTTA   not me   I wanted to believe the best for Barack   I HOPED he would been the CHANGE he professes   but it just doesn t jive with his past.  He voted 98  ultra-liberal   he isn t about to change that now.  He might claim and swear it   but he has NEVER changed ANY of his ideological positions throughout HIS ENTIRE LIFE.  He was born and raised a communist   and he espouses a communist worldview. "

[Laughs] We have always been small  c  communists in the sense that we were never in the [Communist] party and never Stalinists. The ethics of Communism still appeal to me. I don t like Lenin as much as the early Marx.

Firstly, I would personally like to hear the sermon in it&apos;s entirity.  And still there perhaps isn&apos;t anything of value to America within it.  Obama hasn&apos;t said such things, as a matter of fact, far from it.  So it comes down to whether you believe him or you don&apos;t when he denounces and rejects such language.  I happen to believe him.  If McCain would do the same, I&apos;d no doubt believe him as well.  But as of yet I&apos;ve heard nothing from him as far as denouncement or rejection.

What exactly do 10 to 30  of Americans support about Reverend Wright?  Do they support that he served in the Navy for 6 years?  Do they support his sermon, &apos;The Audacity to Hope&apos;:    quote:  In one of his lectures, Dr. Sampson spoke of a painting I remembered studying in humanities courses back in the late &apos;50s. In Dr. Sampson&apos;s powerful description of the picture, he spoke of it being a study in contradictions, because the title and the details on the canvas seem to be in direct opposition.  The painting&apos;s title is &amp;quot;Hope.&amp;quot; It shows a woman sitting on top of the world, playing a harp. What more enviable position could one ever hope to achieve than being on top of the world with everyone dancing to your music?  As you look closer, the illusion of power gives way to the reality of pain. The world on which this woman sits, our world, is torn by war, destroyed by hate, decimated by despair, and devastated by distrust. The world on which she sits seems on the brink of destruction. Famine ravages millions of inhabitants in one hemisphere, while feasting and gluttony are enjoyed by inhabitants of another hemisphere. This world is a ticking time bomb, with apartheid in one hemisphere and apathy in the other. Scientists tell us there are enough nuclear warheads to wipe out all forms of life except cockroaches. That is the world on which the woman sits in Watt&apos;s painting.  Our world cares more about bombs for the enemy than about bread for the hungry. This world is still more concerned about the color of skin than it is about the content of character a world more finicky about what&apos;s on the outside of your head than about the quality of your education or what&apos;s inside your head. That is the world on which this woman sits.  You and I think of being on top of the world as being in heaven. When you look at the woman in Watt&apos;s painting, you discover this woman is in hell. She is wearing rags. Her tattered clothes look as if the woman herself has come through Hiroshima or Nagasaki. Her head is bandaged, and blood seeps through the bandages. Scars and cuts are visible on her face, her arms, and her legs.  I. Illusion of Power vs. Reality of Pain  A closer look reveals all the harp strings but one are broken or ripped out. Even the instrument has been damaged by what she has been through, and she is the classic example of quiet despair. Yet the artist dares to entitle the painting Hope. The illusion of power sitting on top of the world gives way to the reality of pain.  And isn&apos;t it that way with many of us? We give the illusion of being in an enviable position on top of the world. Look closer, and our lives reveal the reality of pain too deep for the tongue to tell. For the woman in the painting, what looks like being in heaven is actually an existence in a quiet hell.  I&apos;ve been a pastor for seventeen years. I&apos;ve seen too many of these cases not to know what I&apos;m talking about. I&apos;ve seen married couples where the husband has a girlfriend in addition to his wife. It&apos;s something nobody talks about. The wife smiles and pretends not to hear the whispers and the gossip. She has the legal papers but knows he would rather try to buy Fort Knox than divorce her. That&apos;s a living hell.  I&apos;ve seen married couples where the wife had discovered that somebody else cares for her as a person and not just as cook, maid jitney service, and call girl all wrapped into one. But there&apos;s the scandal: What would folks say? What about the children? That&apos;s a living hell.  I&apos;ve seen divorcees whose dreams have been blown to bits, families broken up beyond repair, and lives somehow slipping through their fingers. They&apos;ve lost control. That&apos;s a living hell.    The rest of the sermon. &quot;</u>   Maybe you could find us a link? "

Double Life of Barack Obama Wright is wrong for America.  By Thomas Sowell   There is something both poignant and galling about the candidacy of Barack Obama.  Any American, regardless of party or race, has to find it heartening that the country has reached the point where a black candidate for president of the United States sweeps so many primaries in states where the overwhelming majority of the population is white.  We have all seen the crowds enthralled by Barack Obama s rhetoric and theatrical style.   Many of his supporters put their money where their mouths were, so that this recently arrived senator received more millions of dollars in donations than candidates who have been far more visible on the national stage for far more years.  That s the good news. The bad news is that Barack Obama has been leading as much of a double life as Eliot Spitzer.   While talking about bringing us together and deploring  divisive  actions, Senator Obama has for 20 years been a member of a church whose minister, Jeremiah Wright, has said that  God Bless America  should be replaced by  God damn America    among many other wild and even obscene denunciations of American society, including blanket racist attacks on whites.  Nor was this an isolated example. Fox News Channel has played tapes of various sermons of Jeremiah Wright, and says that it has tapes with hours more of the same.   Wright s actions matched his words. He went with Louis Farrakhan to Libya and Farrakhan received an award from his church.  Sean Hannity began reporting on Jeremiah Wright back in April of 2007. But the mainstream media saw no evil, heard no evil, and spoke no evil.   Now that the facts have come out in a number of places, and can no longer be suppressed, many in the media are trying to spin these facts out of existence.  Spin number one is that Jeremiah Wright s words were  taken out of context.  Like most people who use this escape hatch, those who say this do not explain what the words mean when taken in context.  In just what context does  God damn America  mean something different?  Spin number two is that Barack Obama says he didn t hear the particular things that Jeremiah Wright said that are now causing so much comment.  It wasn t just an isolated remark. Nor were the enthusiastic responses of the churchgoers something which suggests that this anti-American attitude was news to them or something that they didn t agree with.  If Barack Obama was not in church that particular day, he belonged to that church for 20 years. He made a donation of more than  20,000 to that church.   In all that time, he never had a clue as to what kind of man Jeremiah Wright was? Give me a break!  You can t be with someone for 20 years, call him your mentor, and not know about his racist and anti-American views.  Neither Barack Obama nor his media spinmeisters can put this story behind him with some facile election-year rhetoric. If Senator Obama wants to run with the rabbits and hunt with the hounds, then at least let the rabbits and the hounds know that.  The fact that Obama talks differently than Jeremiah Wright does not mean that his track record is different. Barack Obama s voting record in the Senate is perfectly consistent with the far-left ideology and the grievance culture, just as his wife s statement that she was never proud of her country before is consistent with that ideology.  Senator Barack Obama s political success thus far has been a blow for equality. But equality has its down side.  Equality means that a black demagogue who has been exposed as a phony deserves exactly the same treatment as a white demagogue who has been exposed as a phony.   We don t need a president of the United States who got to the White House by talking one way, voting a very different way in the Senate, and who for 20 years followed a man whose words and deeds contradict Obama s carefully crafted election-year image.

Martin says. &apos; Play to pay?&apos; I am embarrassed to say that I have been proven wrong by Obama &amp; Co. I thought they would wait until the inauguration to start their financial shenanigans. Obama is out of the starting blocks earlier than I expected.  &apos;Did Obama  resign&apos; his senate seat early to give the Governor an edge in peddling the vacant office to the highest bidder? There is no doubt that Obama&apos;s expedited resignation of his senate seat last month, long before he was required to step down, empowered Blagojevich: it gave Blago expedited authority to enrich himself with an early sale.  &amp;quot;David Axelrod has said Obama and Blagojevich discussed a senate replacement. Was the Obama machine oblivious to what was going on under its nose in downtown Chicago? If they claim they do not know is happening in Chicago politics, are they going to proffer the same defense about their lack of understanding of world politics? Obama&apos;s minions obviously had to know what Blagojevich was up to. Resigning early allowing Blago to cash in early. There appears to have been a deal between Blago and &apos;Bama. Whoa.  &apos;Finally, Obama&apos;s peculiar, expedited resignation makes sense. The possibility that Obama and Blago made a deal is inescapable. It flies in your face. Obama continued to act in his self-styled capacity holding a non-existent office,  Office of the President-Elect,&apos; while the Daley-Obama machine was in high gear trying to resell his seat. The appearance of an Obama-Blagojevich-Axelrod  Senategate&apos; conspiracy stinks to the high heavens. The sewers and cesspools of Illinois politics are overflowing. The stench is so prevalent it may even scare off Santa,&apos; Martin says.  &apos;Governor Blagojevich&apos;s  1 fund raiser, Tony Rezko, was--no surprise--Barack Obama&apos;s  1 fundraiser as well, and helped raise money to fund the purchase of the  Obama compound&apos; on the south side of Chicago. Is there a connection between these men? Obama, Rezko and Blagojevich are linked like a string of German sausages.  &apos;Can you imagine what Washington is going to be like when the Obama-Daley looters descend on the capital? The sacking of Rome will look like a weenie-roast by comparison.&apos;  Martin&apos;s book &apos;Obama: The Man Behind the Mask,&apos; details the long history of links between Barack Obama and sleazy/corrupt Illinois politicians. Martin is currently exploring with his publisher whether to prepare a second book on the fall 2008 campaign and the aftermath of Obama&apos;s election.   Andy Martin is Illinois&apos; most respected corruption fighter; he has over forty years of experience exposing the vermin that control the levers of power in the city and state, see AndyMartin.com. Barack Obama is only a Barry-Come-Lately to the Illinois corruption derby.  Martin is a likely candidate in any special 2009 election or the 2010 election to replace Obama in Washington. He has not offered to buy the office. "

Face it - the GOP and Republicans have so royally  ed this country over the past 8 years that it is going to take us another 8 just to get remotely back on track to undoing this inept administrations screwups - and that is why they got their azz handed to them on a platter on election day.  The smears during the campaign didn&apos;t work.......  The birth certificate BS got laughed out of the US Supreme Court.........  Now they have the audacity to try and claim Obama should be impeached because the azzhat Blagojevich tried to squeeze Obama for money over his Senate seat?

Is Obama part of some BIG pay to play conspiracy or has he just been stringing Bonkers BLAGO along so he could rat him out?  Just what would Obama gain?    Plus the so called Obama choice took herself out of the running last month.    Obama friend Jarrett not interested in Senate seat  UPDATED AT 4:20 P.M.  Posted by John McCormick and Rick Pearson at 3:02 p.m.  Valerie Jarrett, a close friend and adviser to President-elect Barack Obama, today took herself out of the running to replace him in the U.S. Senate.   I am not interested in the Senate seat,  Jarrett told the Tribune in an e-mail this afternoon.  Jarrett s name was high on the list of potential successors to Obama immediately after he won the Nov. 4 presidential election. Under state law, Democratic Gov. Rod Blagojevich gets to name Obama s successor through the next general election in 2010.  Jarrett said she was in meetings with the president-elect in Chicago as part of the White House transition and declined further comment.  Jarrett s announcement follows days of speculation that included recent reports she was Obama s top choice to succeed him in the Senate. Jarrett, a longtime friend of the president-elect and his wife, Michelle, has served as a top Obama campaign adviser and appears likely to serve in an important White House role.  Last week, Obama played down any role in the selection process, saying it was Blagojevich s pick, not his.   I think that the criteria that I would have for my successor would be the same criteria that I d have if I were a voter: Somebody who is capable, somebody who is passionate about helping working families in Illinois meet their dreams,  the president-elect said Friday.  And I think there s going to be a lot of good choices out there, but it is the governor s decision to make, not mine.   Still, Jarrett s announcement came as a surprise to sources close to Blagojevich, who said that representatives for Obama had floated her name on a regular basis.  Obama is the only black in the Senate and Blagojevich had been considering Jarrett, an African-American who heads Habitat Co., a Chicago real-estate development and management firm, to fill the seat. African-Americans have traditionally been a strong constituency for Blagojevich, though a recent Tribune poll showed support among black voters had fallen precipitously.   The list is now shorter,  said one Blagojevich confidant, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak about the selection process.  The governor has said he expects to make a decision by New Year s and is  not interested  in naming himself to the post.  Among those who have expressed interest or are being considered for the post are Reps. Janice Schakowsky of Evanston and Luis Gutierrez and Jesse Jackson Jr. of Chicago; Tammy Duckworth, who heads Blagojevich s department of Veterans  Affairs; and Atty. Gen. Lisa Madigan and state Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias, two potential rivals if the governor seeks a third term.  Also mentioned as a replacement is retiring Illinois Senate President Emil Jones, an African-American and close Blagojevich ally who has served as a mentor to Obama in the legislature. Jones, 73, said Wednesday  it would be a great honor  but declined to speculate on his chances.  But Jones is considered a caretaker replacement and national Democrats want an appointee who can run for re-election and win in two years.  With Blagojevich facing potential pressure to name an African-American to succeed Obama, Jackson has been the most active self-promoter for the high profile job.  Jackson, the son of Rev. Jesse Jackson and a 13-year congressman, went so far as to commission a poll to try to demonstrate to Blagojevich that he would be electable on a statewide basis in 2010 if he were awarded the post. The congressman s staff also has regularly floated news releases and appeared in TV interviews to campaign for the job.  But Blagojevich and the congressman are not close. Sources close to the governor questioned the effort that Jackson was putting into the high-visibility campaigning for the job.   &apos;http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/clout_st/2008/11/obama-friend-ja.html&apos; "

Law suits abound trying to get a copy of the original birth certificate all other Americans are required to produce to get into school, a driver&apos;s license or Social Security card.  We are not allowed to produce a Certificate of Live Birth unless it&apos;s from the State Dept and then it&apos;s a COLBA (the A being &apos;abroad.&apos;) It must be notarized and signed by the official registrar of the state Vital Statistics office.  Anything else isn&apos;t &amp;quot;legal.&amp;quot; (Trust me, I just took my son down to get a driver&apos;s license and they turned down the photo copy of the certificate because the seal wasn&apos;t raised!)  Now, my point.  According to the 20th Amendment section 3, a newly elected President can NOT take office until he shows he&apos;s qualified.  All the oath taking and promises and show does NOT make him President unless he does this first!   Are the oaths we take in the military to uphold and defend the Constitution null and void if the so called &amp;quot;President&amp;quot; says so?  NO!  THAT is the oath we take!

I was born in Kentucky and that&apos;s exactly how mine is titled.  The federal government does not interfere with the birth certificates of individual states.  In each state a &amp;quot;birth certificate&amp;quot; is whatever the state says it is.  Hawaii says that Obama&apos;s is legal - and that&apos;s all the 14th amendment requires.  2.  Here&apos;s an interesting section of Title 8 of the U.S. Code (in regards to the 14th amendment and persons considered &amp;quot;natural born&amp;quot;).  It defines the following as people who are &amp;quot;citizens of the United States at birth:&amp;quot;    Anyone born inside the United States   the person must be &amp;quot;subject to the jurisdiction&amp;quot; of the United States. This would exempt the child of a diplomat, for example, from this provision.     Any Indian or Eskimo born in the United States, provided being a citizen of the U.S. does not impair the person&apos;s status as a citizen of the tribe     Any one born outside the United States, both of whose parents are citizens of the U.S., as long as one parent has lived in the U.S.     Any one born outside the United States, if one parent is a citizen and lived in the U.S. for at least one year and the other parent is a U.S. national     Any one born in a U.S. possession, if one parent is a citizen and lived in the U.S. for at least one year     Any one found in the U.S. under the age of five, whose parentage cannot be determined, as long as proof of non-citizenship is not provided by age 21      Any one born outside the United States, if one parent is an alien and as long as the other parent is a citizen of the U.S. who lived in the U.S. for at least five years (with military and diplomatic service included in this time)      A final, historical condition: a person born before 5/24/1934 of an alien father and a U.S. citizen mother who has lived in the U.S.   Let&apos;s play a game and assume that Barack Obama was not born in Hawaii - as so many claim - and was indeed born outside of the United States... the section I highlighted in bold still nullifies the contention that he is not &amp;quot;natural born&amp;quot;, since, according to the law in title 8 of the United States he was, at the very least,  born to one parent who was a citizen of the United States who had lived in the U.S. for at least five years .

Barack Obama Sr was attending college at the University of Hawaii on an academic scholarship.  The scholarship did not offer Obama Sr. anything in the way of money for extravagant things (like plane tickets home).  Obama Sr. began attending the University of Hawaii in 1959... he graduated in June of 1962 (whereupon he accepted another scholarship to Harvard).  Barack (Jr) was born in August 4, 1961.  If one is to believe that Obama (jr) was born in Kenya - one has to make the leap that Obama (Sr) was suddenly able to spring for a plane ticket to Kenya, not only for himself, but for his pregnant wife too.  All on scholarship money that barely covered his school expenses, let alone his room and board in Hawaii.  Barack Obama Sr. had only been able to come study in Hawaii in the first place by way of a free ticket on a donated charter flight with other Kenyan students.

Charlie Rangel (D-NY), was forced to report on his taxes after the discovery that he had not reported income from a Costa Rican rental property. His excuses for the failure started with blaming his wife, then his accountant and finally the fact that he didn&apos;t speak Spanish.   93,000: the amount of petty cash each Congressional representative voted to give themselves in January 2009 during the height of an economic meltdown.   133,900: the amount Fannie Mae &amp;quot;invested&amp;quot; in Chris Dodd (D-CT), head of the powerful Senate Banking Committee, presumably to repel oversight of the GSE prior to its meltdown. Said meltdown helped touch off the current economic crisis. In only a few years time, Fannie also &amp;quot;invested&amp;quot; over  105,000 in then-Senator Barack Obama.   140,000: the amount of back taxes and interest that Cabinet nominee Tom Daschle (D) was forced to cough up after the vetting process revealed significant, unexplained tax liabilities.   356,000: the approximate amount of income and deductions that Daschle (D) was forced to report on his amended 2005 and 2007 tax returns after being caught cheating on his taxes. This includes  255,256 for the use of a car service,  83,333 in unreported income, and  14,963 in charitable contributions..   800,000: the amount of &amp;quot;sweetheart&amp;quot; mortgages Senate Banking Chairman Chris Dodd (D-CT) received from Countrywide Financial, the details for which he has refused to release details despite months of promises to do so. Countrywide was once the nation&apos;s largest mortgage lender and linked to Govern ment-Sponsored Entities like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Their meltdown precipitated the current financial crisis. Just days ago in Pennsylvania , Countrywide was forced to pay  150,000,000 in mortgage assistance following &amp;quot;a state investigation that concluded that Countrywide relaxed its underwriting standards to sell risky loans to consumers who did not understand them and could not afford them.&amp;quot;   1,000,000: the estimated amount of donations by Denise Rich, wife of fugitive Marc Rich, to Democrat interests and the William J. Clinton Foundation in an apparent quid pro quo deal that resulted in a pardon for Mr. Rich. The pardon was reviewed and blessed by Obama Attorney General and then Deputy AG Eric Holder, despite numerous requests by government officials to turn it down..   12,000,000: the amount of TARP money provided to community bank  OneUnited  despite the fact that it did not qualify for funds, and was &amp;quot;under attack from its regulators for allegations of poor lending practices and executive-pay abuses.&amp;quot; It turns out that Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), a key contributor to the Fannie Mae meltdown, just happens to be married to one of the bank&apos;s ex-directors.   23,500,000: The upper range of net worth Rep. Allan Mollohan (D-WV) accumulated in four years time according to The Washington Post through earmarks of &amp;quot;tens of millions of dollars to groups associated with his own business partners.&amp;quot;   2,000,000,000: ( 2 billion) the approximate amount of money that House Appropriations Chairman David Obey (D-WI) is earmarking related to his son&apos;s lobbying efforts. Craig Obey is &amp;quot;a top lobbyist for the nonprofit group&amp;quot; that would receive a roughly  2 billion component of the &amp;quot;Stimulus&amp;quot; package.   3,700,000,000: ( 3.7 billion) not to be outdone, this is the estimated value of various defense contracts awarded to a company controlled by the husband of Rep. Diane Feinstein (D-CA). Despite an obvious conflict-of-interest as &amp;quot;a member of the Military Construction Appropriations subcommittee, Sen. Feinstein voted for appropriations worth billions to her husband&apos;s firms .&amp;quot;   4,190,000,000: ( 4.19 billion) the amount of money in the so-called &amp;quot;Stimulus&amp;quot; package devoted to fraudulent voter registration ACORN group under the auspices of &amp;quot;Community Stabilization Activities&amp;quot;. ACORN is currently the subject of a RICO suit in Ohio.   1,646,000,000,000 ( 1..646 trillion): the approximate amount of annual United States exports endangered by the &amp;quot;Stimulus&amp;quot; package, which provides a &amp;quot;Buy American&amp;quot; stricture. According to international trade experts, a &amp;quot;US-EU trade war looms&amp;quot;, which could result in a worldwide economic depression reminiscent of that touched off by the protectionist Smoot-Hawley Act.

His excuses for the failure started with blaming his wife, then his accountant and finally the fact that he didn&apos;t speak Spanish.   93,000: the amount of petty cash each Congressional representative voted to give themselves in January 2009 during the height of an economic meltdown.   133,900: the amount Fannie Mae &amp;quot;invested&amp;quot; in Chris Dodd (D-CT), head of the powerful Senate Banking Committee, presumably to repel oversight of the GSE prior to its meltdown.
