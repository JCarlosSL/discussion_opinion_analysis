abortion_as_rights_or_choices	409192893_1100030352001	1	IHAWKER	Fri 11 June 2010 02:46 AM	 Bill includes amendment to allow abortions at overseas bases   WASHINGTON   A Senate provision to allow abortions at overseas military bases could set up an election year fight between abortion rights supporters and conservative lawmakers who have thwarted the measure for years.  Senate Republicans threatened to block the full defense authorization bill when it comes up for a vote later this month after the abortion provision was attached in the chamber s Armed Services Committee mark-up.  Under the amendment, female servicemembers and military dependents stationed overseas would have access to abortions, provided they pay for the procedure themselves and medical personnel on base are willing to perform it. No military doctors would be required to perform abortions if they object to the practice.  In a statement, amendment sponsor Sen. Roland Burris, D-Ill., framed the issue as one of basic fairness for the tens of thousands of female troops and family members stationed outside the United States.   It is critical that we provide the highest quality care for our service members while they are serving our nation overseas, and that includes allowing women and their families the right to choose at facilities operated under the Department of Defense,  he said.  Under current law, physicians at overseas bases can perform abortions only when the mother s life is in danger, or in cases of rape or incest. In the latter two, women still must pay for the procedure themselves.  In recent years, similar proposals to allow overseas abortions have been offered in the House and Senate as part of the annual budget bills, but failed before they could become law. The issue was not broached in the House this year, and House Armed Services Committee Chairman Ike Skelton, D-Mo., restated his public opposition to a change in the policy.  The American Civil Liberties Union and NARAL Pro-Choice America both backed Burris  plan. In a statement earlier this month, Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., called the abortion amendment  a moral failure of this Congress  and promised to fight to remove the provision.   Since the mid-1990s, attempts to change this law have been rejected repeatedly,  he said.  Regardless of their views on whether abortion is ever justified, the vast majority of Americans agree that taxpayer dollars should not subsidize such controversial procedures.   Both the House and Senate versions of the defense authorization bill already include repeal language for the military s  don t ask, don t tell  law, a controversial move that Republicans in both chambers predicted could jeopardize passage of the final bill. Twenty-six House Democrats voted against the  don t ask, don t tell  provision, but the full measure passed by a 229-186 margin.  The Senate is expected to vote later this month on the authorization bill, which includes the abortion provision, and a conference committee will work on differences between the House and Senate versions throughout the summer.

Why do military women serving overseas have to be subjected to second-class (or lower) health care than their civilian counterparts in the US?  I think it&apos;s offensive that they would have to pay for it themselves to begin with.  I agree that providers (doctors, nurse) should have the option to refuse to perform an abortion if they object, but the women themselves have absolutely every right to all the healthcare benefits available to their civilian counterparts in CONUS!

abortion_as_rights_or_choices	409192893_1100030352001	15	OldArmyLove	Sat 12 June 2010 12:09 AM	I might as well throw in my two cents:  Last week I reconnected Mary   with a lady who was in first grade with me, way back in 1943.  Our mothers worked together in the school cafeteria.   Her two older sisters were the same age as my two older brothers.  The families were good friends.   We have not seen each other in sixty  years.  Now she lives in Tenseness about two miles from our youngest daughter and family.     But, the one thing that is locked in both of our memories from first grade is the day we were told that her 14 year old sister, Margret   died.    Margret died because she was pregnant and her mother tried to abort the baby with a coat hanger or some other such method.  What a horrible way for anyone to die.  We all believed that it was incest.  There were never any charges against her mother.  It was just the way things were done in those days.      Yes, we had a home for unwed mothers,  The Florence Crittenton Home.   But, the shame that families felt in those days was enormous and almost unbearable.      I m unashamedly  prolife  - I believe that life begins at conception.  In Margret s case we lost both the young mother and the unborn baby.   I m confident that everyone wishes there would never be another abortion.  But, we can not go back to the days of the  coat hanger abortions.    Personal notes:  We are thankful that we could not have gotten an abortion in 1971 while stationed in Kinzening Germany. I think we what have jumped at the opportunity.  My wife was not well and it was a tough permanency.  But, we would have missed having one of the greatest young men God very created, our youngest Timothy Robert John Love now 38. He has been married for 16 years to a wonderful wife and they have two terrific young children, our Caleb and Abbey.   Also our oldest granddaughter most likely would have been aborted if it was possible.  She is the apple of her mom and dad and grandparent eyes.    To paraphrase Patrick Henry, I say, I know not what others may choose but, as for me, give me a country where abortions of any type is not necessary or wanted.  Until then lets may it a last, but a very safe choice of the mother.   I just don t know how to make a no abortion  deportation  rule work.

Focusing on only teaching abstinence in public schools is a totally naive and stupid concept.  Teach all aspects of sex, not just abstinence.  Teens are going to explore, they will engage in all forms of sex, and they are being put in serious jepardy by not being informed about the consequences of STD and unwanted pregnancies.  Provide real information on birth control methods.  Provide condoms without question or restriction; provide meaningful guidance information on oral birth control contraceptives, and start it early.  Social conservatives are demanding that sex education be sanitized and want it to be a family issue alone.  Sure, the parents SHOULD be the ones responsible to do this, but the cold hard fact is that they are NOT doing it. Then what? Every year, younger children are engaging in risky sexual activities and suffer emotional trauma, sexually transmitted diseases that are increasingly difficult to treat and cure, and babies are having babies.   Teach them, provide them with information and hope they make a good choice...but never forget that they will engage in sexual activities and if we don&apos;t understand and accept that fact, and depoliticize it, then nothing will change...

abortion_as_rights_or_choices	409192893_1100030352001	45	OldArmyLove	Sun 13 June 2010 02:30 PM	Moderators  hat off!     I just realized, I posted the original draft of this just after midnight last night.  Sometime, I do strange things in my sleep. Oh well, pick and choose from each of them or ignore both of them.                Service members and their families should ever be denied a government entitlement that is available to general population.      We all have different views on this topic for many different reasons. I would like to share the following, all true;  Last week, I reconnected with Mary  , through a classmates forum, a lady who was in first grade with me, way back in 1943.  Our mothers worked together in the school cafeteria.   Her two older sisters were the same age as my two older brothers.  The families were good friends.   We have not seen or spoke or talked with each other in sixty  years.  Now she lives in Tenseness about two miles from our youngest daughter and family.     But, the one thing that is locked in both of our memories from first grade is the day we were told that her 14 year old sister, Margret died.    Margret died because she was pregnant and her mother tried to abort the baby with a coat hanger or some other such method.  What a horrible way for anyone to die.  We all believed that it was incest.  There were never any charges against her mother or anyone else.  It was just the way things were done in those days.      Yes, we had a home for unwed mothers,  The Florence Crittenton Home.   But, the shame that families felt in those days was enormous and almost unbearable.      I m unashamedly  prolife  - I believe that life begins at conception.  In Margret s case both the young mother and the unborn baby were lost.     Personal notes:  My grandmother, a very small Pima Indian, died giving birth to my mother and her twin brother.  The doctor said, she was too small to give birth to twins.  That was 1896 and there was no such thing as a safe abortion.  The stories we ve been told about how the my grandmother death impacted my grandmother, I m confident that he would, if it were possible, chosen my grandmother s life over the life of the twins.  As soon as my mother discovered she was pregnant with me, she was advised to have an abortion.  I would be her seventh child.  My father had just been confined the in Florida insane asylum.  My next older sibling was very not in good health.  The family vas  dirt poor  and I would be another mouth to feed.  My mother would not even consider it   I m sure in part her decision was based on the circumstances of her own birth.   I m thankful for the life that my mother gave me.   We are thankful that we could not have gotten an abortion in 1971 while stationed in Kitzingen Germany. I think we what have jumped at the opportunity.  We didn t want anymore children.  My wife was not well and it was a tough permanency.  If she/we would have had the abortion, we would have missed having one of the greatest young men God very created, our youngest son Timothy now 38. He has been married for 16 years to a wonderful a terrific young lady.  They are parents of two loving wonderful children, our Caleb and our Abbey.   After Tim s birth, I visited the doctor and had  the procedure.   As a father and husband, if given the option of choosing the life of my wife over the life of our unborn child, I would always choose my wife.  My final thoughts: Abortion should never be a substitute for birth control and this horrible  partial birth abortion  procedure is in MN2BHO, nothing but infanticide.     The statement by my much loved friend,      an individual woman&apos;s right to choose what is done to HER body    has to be given a lot of weight.  But, prostitution is outlawed in most states as is drug use, and these both affect a persons use and control over their own body.    Finally, I don t know how to reduce the astronomical number abortion. I m confident that everyone wishes there would never be another abortion.  But, we can not and must not, go back to the days of the  coat hanger abortions.  The answer might be education, education, education.

Mind you I was not an angel as a teenager, but I was a virgin until I was 23.  Likely I would still be a virgin today if me and this one ol gal hadn&apos;t gotten completely blitzed and found ourselves in a compromising position the next morning.  Now that being said.  Parents, talk to your kids about sex, drugs, and all those other uncomfortable subjects.  Kids and young military personell, don&apos;t do it, if you do, use protection, I don&apos;t care if you are male, female, both, or neither, use protection.  It is cheaper than an abortion, and frankly, folks like me would like to see abortions used safely and very rarely, and I don&apos;t want to hear about some young servicemember getting killed at an abortion clinic by some whacko either.  Should service members have access to abortions over seas?  Absolutely, IMHO they should as sometimes they are needed, say the health/life of the mother, rape, ect.  I do not feel they should be available as an alternative form of birth control or because a woman doesn&apos;t want to wear the maternity uniform.  Also, doctors should have an opt out for such things as well.  I want my doctor to wholeheartedly be in favor of any operation he is doing on me and I want him to have the experience and knowledge as well.  I wouldn&apos;t want a brain surgeon operating on me that is against using certain techniques on moral grounds to be the one doing the operation where that method is required, would you?  Same goes for abortions as well.  Do you want someone who is oposed to the operation working on your naughty bits?...I wouldn&apos;t.

We are no longer conscripting people for military service so if a doctor or medical person does not want to follow orders to perform abortions, then they should not enlist or accept a commission.  If they do, then they have to also accept that they may be called on to perform abortions and should expect to follow orders or face legal consequences.&quot;</u>    Another advocate for freedom of choice is heard from.

abortion_as_rights_or_choices	409192893_2520020171001	1	machiavellean	Fri 22 February 2008 10:08 PM	 How far are you willing to go with a    woman s right to choose   ?    What I have in mind are child-bearing questions other than a woman s right to choose whether or not to have an abortion, either on demand or with some restrictions.   Does a woman have the right to choose the sex of the baby she carries? The color of the baby s eyes and hair? To have triplets? . . . What voice does her partner   husband or otherwise   have in her decision? Does a woman have the right to choose to have a baby against her husband s wishes?   Natallie was diagnosed with ovarian cancer  .  Before doctors removed both her ovaries, she and her partner, Howard, had six embryos fertilized with his sperm. The embryos were then frozen and stored.  The couple broke up. Howard withdrew his consent for the embryos to be used and asked that they be destroyed.  Natallie wanted to implant the embryos and sued to be allowed to do so without his permission.   She has argued he had already consented to their creation, storage and use, and should not be allowed to change his mind.  Current [national] laws require both the man and woman to give consent, and allow either party to withdraw that consent up to the point where the embryos are implanted.  Her lawyers argue that the right to a family life is enshrined in [an international] Convention of Human Rights and that she should be allowed to implant the embryos.   How would you rule? If national and international laws weren t involved, would you feel different?

Reading through you post gave me this idea:  castrate or shoot every man that gets a woman pregnant without the benefit of marriage or is not willing to marry her when the condition is discovered.

No, a woman should not be able to sue to get her ex-husbands frozen goods because she no longer has ovaries to produce.  If she does - then she will sue him for child support even though he was against it.  After all - it is his child as well. If she is that deperate to have children, she should ADOPT.  I&apos;m not going to get into abortion, it has been argued too many times on this web page.

In every instance where the man DID NOT want to be a father the woman&apos;s decision has final say and the man has no recourse. He is then  BY LAW  required to support that child for 18  years. How is that fair? We have no rights in whether the child is born yet we have the responsibility to support that child?? That is the biggest problem I have with the issue. Now, if you absolve the man of his responsiblity to support that child, who will? The taxpayers? If the woman can&apos;t support herself and the child, is it right to make the public support her/them? That is why the public (read courts) have so much weight in making decisions affecting procreation. I personally don&apos;t believe in abortion and due to my persuasiveness in dealing with my ex, I now have a 19 year old son. I have raised him with the help of my family and my current wife without any assistance from his biological mother. That I haven&apos;t needed public assistance should be irrelevant to the state (to which I pay taxes) in their providing me with the same services they provide to others. But I am satisfied with the results and only want equality for everyone dealing with these kind of situations, both men and women.

But, if you want to talk choice, women, and men alike, made the choice to sleep with each other.  Taking the life of a child, even unborn or fetal, is wrong in every way.  The choice was made when they chose to have sex.  There is protection available; there are condoms, anti-sperm creams, birth control pills and much more that people can use, but too ignorant, or a better term IDIOTIC, to use such things to prevent unwanted children.  There are plenty of families out there that are unable to have children at all who would love the chance to become parents.  There are also plenty of children out there right now who NEED good parents to take care of them.  Choice?  The choice was made when they CHOSE to have sex with each other.  There are only certain cases I agree with abortion and those are rape, molestation, incest and/or sexual abuse.

Women in abusive relationships tend to get beaten more often while they are pregnant, making miscarriages and stillbirths more likely.

However, I believe in any form of birth control as long as it prevents unwanted children instead of abortion.  When I hear of people who have gotten pregnant because they didn&apos;t use protection of any kind, and now are with a child they never wanted and/or too young to actually care for a child I consider STUPID.  Even young kids know about forms of birth control, yet the continue to fore go the usage of such items.  Another point along this line is that parents are not teaching their kids properly also about sex and preventative measures from teen pregnancies.  Still, I believe in birth control, and have even known several men who have had vasectomies to prevent more children, and women who have had their tubes tied.  The point is, people of this day and age are quite aware of STD&apos;s &amp; VD&apos;s, plus AIDS.  Yet, they are too stupid to use the 2 brain cells in their head to have thought better and end up with a child that they did not want.  Instead of thinking with the big head on the shoulders, men are thinking with the small head in their pants, and girls/women should have the brains enough to also prevent it also.  To me, they are just as guilty as the men are.  But, my belief in &apos;Pro-Choice&apos; is that they made the choice to not use protection and were stupid enough to get pregnant.  I&apos;m very much &apos;Pro-Life&apos;.  But, like I also said, I only believe in abortion in certain cases; rape, molestation and incestual pregnancies.

The only 100  effective contraception method would be a hysterectomy or castration. Everything else, including sterilization, has a failure rate and contraindications. Coercive sex and coerced pregnancy is shockingly common in abusive relationships, and recent research has turned up that teenage boys are coercing their girlfriends into having sex and getting pregnant. So, walk a mile in the shoes of a girl whose boyfriend has been puncturing his condoms without her knowledge, and tell me what you think.

I told him that if they were choosing abortion, that it&apos;s safer to do so early, but he refused to consider doing so earlier. He then said &amp;quot;I don&apos;t need a girl&amp;quot;. This is done in India- and some places are suffering from a lack of available women as a result. Do they then decide to quit aborting or abandoning girls? No, they buy or kidnap women from neighboring areas. Misogyny will be the end of us all.

What I have in mind are child-bearing questions other than a woman s right to choose whether or not to have an abortion, either on demand or with some restrictions.   Does a woman have the right to choose the sex of the baby she carries? The color of the baby s eyes and hair? To have triplets? . . . What voice does her partner   husband or otherwise   have in her decision? Does a woman have the right to choose to have a baby against her husband s wishes?   Natallie was diagnosed with ovarian cancer  .  Before doctors removed both her ovaries, she and her partner, Howard, had six embryos fertilized with his sperm. The embryos were then frozen and stored.  The couple broke up. Howard withdrew his consent for the embryos to be used and asked that they be destroyed.  Natallie wanted to implant the embryos and sued to be allowed to do so without his permission.   She has argued he had already consented to their creation, storage and use, and should not be allowed to change his mind.  Current [national] laws require both the man and woman to give consent, and allow either party to withdraw that consent up to the point where the embryos are implanted.  Her lawyers argue that the right to a family life is enshrined in [an international] Convention of Human Rights and that she should be allowed to implant the embryos.   How would you rule? If national and international laws weren t involved, would you feel different?&quot;</u>   Good questions Mach!  My personal belief ONLY - &amp;quot;Only a woman ever really knows who the father is.&amp;quot;  Words I heard when I was very little and over which much ado has been made in popular culture over the subsequent 50 years.  How many babies are born without benefit of a dad in the picture - for example, a one night stand that definitively altered a woman&apos;s life and opportunities because she chose life over the convenience of an abortion?  Should a sperm donor have a right to abort baby because he doesn&apos;t like where his sperm has been donated?  In this case the couple broke up - but the &amp;quot;dad&amp;quot; was still nothing more than an unknown sperm donor to an unknown egg.  She should be allowed to be implanted with the fertilized in vitros and the extent of the donor&apos;s parental rights should be to have a certificate not name him as father but rather reflect the unknown identity of the donor.  Just like any other sperm donor, he should have the right to forever relinquish claim on the child as his own - financially and legally.    Just my humble opinions, Mach.  Very good ethical questions.

She has no means of support and the father probably doesn&apos;t either.  If the parents had any brains in their heads they would have their daughter on birth control.  You know that kids are becoming sexually active at a younger age.  Is this young girl suppose to have this baby and the grandparents raise it?  I believe NO.

However, I believe that God gave us the free will to choose our destinies right or wrong and based on that principle I am against any legislation that would in anyway for my choice and beliefs on others unless their choice somehow impedes mine and everyone else.  The real question is who is she effecting (not affecting)?  So believe the soul enters at conception, some believe upon first breath, I believe that beliefs should not be legislated, only hard core facts.  We can prove those beliefs can we?  What we can prove is that sperm mixed with an egg goes through multiple stages before you have something that resembles a human and then it is born.  Personally, I believe in a middle ground but most are too arrogant and only want their way legislated.  I say give a woman up to the first trimester, anything after that better have multiple signatures.  Most can agree that a woman knows she is pregnant within a month anyway, anything after that is just irresponsible or lazy.  You should know within a week of finding out how you feel or want to do, not at the point when a baby is kicking.  Just my 2 cents.

If a woman is not expecting to be pregnant, then she&apos;d likely be past your threshold by the time she finds out that she is pregnant. I&apos;m in favor of bringing back menstrual extraction. It&apos;s low-risk, convenient, and can end very early pregnancies. If a woman thinks she may have gotten pregnant during a particular encounter and it&apos;s a mite too late for EC, menstrual extraction could be used even before most home pregnancy tests could detect a pregnancy. And if she&apos;s not pregnant, she would simply have a shorter, lighter period.

If a female is sexually active, what&apos;s an 18 dollar test a month?    I&apos;ll stand by my one month policy.  There needs to be a degree of responsibility, with the man and the woman.    Offer the pregnancy tests for free.  Do what it takes.  40 million dead is far too many, in my opinion.

Or should I google it?    If a female is sexually active, what&apos;s an 18 dollar test a month?    I&apos;ll stand by my one month policy.  There needs to be a degree of responsibility, with the man and the woman.    Offer the pregnancy tests for free.  Do what it takes.  40 million dead is far too many, in my opinion.    If nothing else, just think of the taxes that would have been generated off those individuals.&quot;</u>   I can see where you are coming from, however you should know that most pregnancies are detected at 6-7 weeks, which is almost 2 month. The blood test could probably dedect it at around 4-5 weeks, but doctors would tell a woman to come back for a second test 2 or 3 weeks later. So the argument for abortion during the first month of pregnancy has no base.   I believe that abortion is a moral issue and every woman should take it up with herself of wether she wants to go against moral ground or not. I have had 4 children, my first one when I was 16. At this time in my life everybody advised me that it would be better to have an abortion. However, my innerself told me that I wont be able to cope with it. Having an abortion is a very hard decission and is not being made lightly, however, I think we should respect a woman&apos;s decission, especially in cases of incest and rape.   Also, I would like to ad, that some methodes of birth control prevent an egg from implanting into the uterus after conception. That would mean, using this kind of birth control is a form or killing.   And most of all, I would like to know where you get the fact from that black babies are higher priced in Germany? As far as I know, it is against the law in Germany to &amp;quot;buy&amp;quot; a child...

abortion_as_rights_or_choices	5531905206_6420099791001	37	Grachus	Sat 06 September 2008 06:30 PM	This as everyone knows is a topic that had been beaten, hacked, mutilated to death.   But let me pose some questions. Some believe that abortion is the death of a human being. There is no qualifications being expressed - Abortions kills a human being.  So.  1. If abortion consists of taking a human life, no different than taking any other human life, would it be proper then to inflict either the death penalty or life in prison (depending on whether you believe in Capital punishment)?  It would seem to automatically follow. So I ask this for those who believe abortion is murder.   Second: Most of those who want punishment for abortion, advocate little or no punishment for the woman, but harsh penalties for the abortionist. Does this make sense? The woman after all is the one who looked for, hired, and paid the &amp;quot;hit man,&amp;quot; who is more of an &amp;quot;accessory to the crime&amp;quot; then the Mr. Big, i.e., the woman who hired him.  It would seem to me, that even those who say that a fetus is a full fledged human being, in practice do NOT see the fetus as a full fledged human being.  If the fetus is such a human, why then are the proposed penalties, almost nothing for the woman, and even for the practicing abortionist, only five years. Is this not a contradiction? If a human being is a human being - Why the shilly shallying attitude?  Third. If a fetus is a full fledged human being, why are there many people who recogise an &amp;quot;exception&amp;quot; if the life of the woman is in danger. Is there any other legal situation in which we allow ourselves to choose which individual lives and which dies?   So once again it would seem to me that those who see the fetus as a full fledged human, are sort of hedging their bets.   Finally, while the point has been made that there is a difference between a fetus and a sperm or an egg, is there a Moral difference? Is birth control which prevents an egg being fertislised ok, different from birth control that eliminates a fertislised egg? I ask this because the second example is &amp;quot;abortion&amp;quot; in the moral sense of the word.  To sum up, it seems to me, that we are drawing lines in the sand, always a risky proposition. Would it not be best to draw that line, after the birth of the fetus, and declare that birth to be the moment of legal transformation?  I say this because in my opinion, birth control is morally just as much an abortion as the medical procedure.   Dave

All of a sudden, crime just went way down, early 90&apos;s I think.  This coincides with when abortion became legal.  There are many who draw a line from that.  They feel that if abortions hadn&apos;t been made legal, America would have been over run with crime.  Who knows?  I do see the logic in that, though.  As for the comment on what should we do with mothers who procede with the abortion?  I saw a guy on youtube asking protesters the same thing outside clinics.  They really didn&apos;t know, and the guy thought he was the cat&apos;s meow because of that fact.  I&apos;ve got a solution.  Sterilize them.  It&apos;s harsh, but it&apos;s a punishment.

It would be far healthier to further efforts to prevent unwanted pregnancies and make adoption a better option.

I don&apos;t see how anyone can possibly explain away the fact that once an egg is fertilized it is a living being. Some societies consider a child to be a year old when it is born.  I have always heard discussion on this issue, and it was always a decision between the father, mother, and doctor, but it was usually because of a health risk to the child or mother. If it was an unwanted pregnancy, a family member somewhere usually raised it, or it was put up for adoption. (In more recent times I actually knew a women who used this as a &amp;quot;birth control&amp;quot; method.  Unsat.) In this time the problem of ignorance, selfishness, and irresponsibility with the use of harmful practices (drugs, enviornment, etc.) make it even more of a complicated issue, I know. Love and concern would help.   I have always desired to do, and see, programs wherein a mother who wishes to keep her baby, but has been abandoned by whomever could stay in a nice house, be active in choirs, cooking , etc; learn methods of child care, and relationships. Women from the community could teach the womanly arts, exercise programs, yoga, etc on a volunteer basis. After the child is born have six months to visit a career/job/mental health councilor, work, get housing, and integrate back into society.   Abstinence is possible. Men need to use protection!! Somehow we skip right over the responsibility of men to stop...think, and get married if they just can&apos;t control themselves. This is not a national sport. It is the life of a prescious, prescious child, and men should be held just as accountable. It should be considered a dishonor to &amp;quot;knock someone up&amp;quot;, instead of a great feat of accomplishment. Anyone can do that.  This is not an unrealistic venture providing it be kept in the civilian sector with little government involvement...just community, churches, volunteers, donations, etc. Waivers would have to be signed, of course for liability purposes, and if the woman choose not to go along with the program then find their own means. Bring back the human, family, community concept.  Don&apos;t leave this burden on society, the government, and clinics!

That&apos;s the problem here.

A woman who takes the appropriate precaution in regards to birth control (abstinence) has zero risk of getting pregnant unless she is raped.  One is in control of the situation and assumes repsonsiblity because she is knowingly taking a risk.  The second has done EVERYTHING in her power to avoid getting pregnant and she should be assisted in every way for doing the right thing should she be victimized.  Do you still believe a woman sleeping around but is popping a pill is absolved of the repsonsibility of murdering a child when she chooses abortion? 
abortion_as_rights_or_choices	5531905206_6420099791001	47	undercoversister	Sat 06 September 2008 10:37 PM	In order to keep this discussion going, I thought I would throw in some facts:  21  feel that they do not have the financial resources to bring up a child.    21  feel that they are not ready for the responsibility of raising a child.    16  feel that their life would be changed too much. She might have a plan for her future (education, developing a career, etc.) that does not allow for having a child at the present time. She might be looking after an elderly parent and does not have sufficient time or energy to commit to a baby.    12  feel that her relationship with her partner is in difficulty.    11  feel that they are too young, and not sufficiently mature to become a mother.    In 8  of the cases, her children are grown and she does not want to start another family, or she has all the children that she wants.   Some of these reasons may be influenced by: Pressure from the father or from her parents to have an abortion.    She feels that she lacks the emotional and physical strength to go through another pregnancy and raise the child.    She believes that raising an additional child would short-change her existing children.    She is a student and/or without a partner; she feels that raising a child would be too difficult and disruptive at her time in life.    She doesn&apos;t want other people to know that she became pregnant.    A child would interfere with her career or education.    She may fear physical abuse from a parent if they learn of her pregnancy.    She may fear being tossed out onto the street by a parent if they learn of her pregnancy.    In the case of a multiple pregnancy, the woman may be faced with giving birth to more newborns than she feels she can deal with.    That being tosses out there....it looks like all of those &amp;quot;circumstances&amp;quot; could be changed for the better, so that pregnant woman wont feel the way they do right now. I think this is the key to reduce abortions and no matter what party affiliation, I think we can all agree that we would like to see the number of abortions reduced.

Is birth control which prevents an egg being fertislised ok, different from birth control that eliminates a fertislised egg? I ask this because the second example is &amp;quot;abortion&amp;quot; in the moral sense of the word.  To sum up, it seems to me, that we are drawing lines in the sand, always a risky proposition. Would it not be best to draw that line, after the birth of the fetus, and declare that birth to be the moment of legal transformation?  I say this because in my opinion, birth control is morally just as much an abortion as the medical procedure.   Dave&quot;</u>  The idea is killing one instance and murder in another.  Killing is seen as moral or legal taking of a life as in self-defense, execution because of a crime committed, or national defense.  Murder on the other hand is the unlawful or immoral taking of life.  An aborted child comes most often as the result of a woman who had consensual sex with no intent of having and keeping a child.  The situation of getting pregnant is avoidable in these cases but a priority of sexual gratification is made over the life of the resulting child.  In the case of an execution someone has forfeited their own life (not another&apos;s) by their actions.  They are guilty where in the previous scenario, the executee is not.  You say &amp;quot;Most of those who want punishment for abortion, advocate little or no punishment for the woman, but harsh penalties for the abortionist.&amp;quot;  To be honest, I&apos;ve never met a person who&apos;s advocated that.  Those I know who oppose abortion merely want the procedure to be illegal for all or some abortions.  The only time an abortionist would be &amp;quot;punished&amp;quot; fpr an abortion is if they knowingly performed an illegal abortion.  You ask about choosing who lives and who dies in a legal situation.  And the answer is a simple yes.  A police officer has the right to kill a person who is threatening the life of another and is in the position to make it happen.  You also ask the difference between egg, sperm, and fetus.  An egg alone cannot produce a human.  A sperm alone cannot produce a human.  A fertilized egg is the most basic stage of human life.  To answer the follow up question about birth control that prevents a fertilized egg from taking hold and the birth control that prevents an egg from being fertilized, there is an obvious difference.  The easiest answer that solves all the problems except the supposed need that a person just has to have sex is that one abstain.  I see one form of BC as particularly reprehensible because as you state it is a form of abortion.  It&apos;s easy to say wait for the birth to be the point a person is declared human but it ignores all kinds of biology in doing so.

You know, the guy who takes upskirt shots of women without their knwoledge and then posts them on the internet and nothing happens and there is no recourse kind of injustice?  I&apos;ve seen plenty of decisions by the Supreme Court that have no basis in the Constitution (think of the property being stolen from families and being given to big business for the supposed greater good of the community).  Lastly, ending a child&apos;s life with murder isn&apos;t taking responsibility, abstaining until you are ready to deal with a pregnancy is taking responsibility.  Liberal logic is so disturbing.  Driver:  Yeah I shot the guy in the head to put him out of his misery. Investigator:  Put him out of his misery? Driver:  Yeah, I was driving home and hit this guy right in front of his house.  He was on the side of the road in terrible agony. Investigator:  You didn&apos;t think about calling an ambulance? Driver:  Oh sure, but once you consider the outrageous costs of medical care,  hic  the lost work, his current pain, the obvious fact that he&apos;s dirt poor... staggers about before regaining his balance  you see that Pinto he&apos;s got parked in the driveway of that single-wide?...and would have to spend years in rehab...look at how twisted his legs and arms are...I figured the right thing to do was to prevent any difficulties in life for him. Investigator:  Wow.  You seem rather detatched from the tragedy that&apos;s occured. Driver:  Detached?  I did the responsible thing.  What should I feel for being responsible? Investigator:  (looking at the empties strewn about the driver&apos;s car)  Sir, Have you been drinking? Driver:   almost falls over laughing  Oh yeah, I&apos;m frickin&apos; hammered. Investigator:  Thanks, for being Frank... Driver:  My name&apos;s not Frank... smiles  Investigator:  You said you were being responsible by ending that guy&apos;s life.  Wouldn&apos;t it have been responsible to not have been drinking in the first place? Driver:  Dude!  It was lady&apos;s night and I almost scored and this guy didn&apos;t have anything worth living for.&quot;</u>  You cannot force society to conform to your personal moral standards. Sex between consenting adults is not, has not and never will be illegal. You disapprove of abortion. I get that. But you are not going to force anyone to have a child they don&apos;t want...unless you are willing to bear all the costs associated with that child. Abstinence is a great theory. It&apos;s never going to happen. Why??? Inherent biological traits for reproduction. Our bodies practically force us to copulate. Making the personal choice of whether or not having a child is the right thing is not our right to legislate. As for your little parable...well you forgot about the wife and three kids that guy was supporting. Not quite the same a fetus that is or isn&apos;t fully developed into a human.

The situation of getting pregnant is avoidable in these cases but a priority of sexual gratification is made over the life of the resulting child.     I always find the above odd. No offense, but generally speaking even married couples have sex far more often then the simple need for reproduction. May I suggest that if the above is a legitimate criterium, then sex for other than reproductive reasons be outlawed? After all, condemns fail, some birth control pills are actually refurbished gummy bears made in China, and as we always say, &amp;quot;Schit happens.&amp;quot;  Can a mass of undifferentiated cells be declared a human being with all the rights guaranteed? And if this is true, what is the moral difference in one mass of cells and another?     Is it not true that the fertilised egg has about as much chance of developing into a human being as the egg alone, if it wasn&apos;t for the human being who is carrying them? Would it not be fair to say that the decision to carry that fetus should be the decision of that human being?    quote:  Originally posted by Silverbusa: It&apos;s easy to say wait for the birth to be the point a person is declared human but it ignores all kinds of biology in doing so.&quot;</u>   I agree. I would like a cut and dried, unequivocal answer that is not messed up with moral questions or when this cell or that becomes a human being.   So for example the Catholic Church seeks this unequivocal answer by saying that birth control IS the moral equivalent of abortion. Others set the boundry later, and others set the boundry even later then that.  But I agree with the logic, if not the conclusions of the Catholic Chruch. To prevent the fertilisation of an egg that would be otherwise fertilised is moraly the same as a full fledged abortion.   If I create a situation that leads to a death, legally I am considered culpable, and if not charged with murder itself, I can be charged with &amp;quot;Man Slaughter,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Negiligent Homicide.&amp;quot;  I solve this delemma by declaring that Birth itself is the moral line in the sand.   But while I respect your opinion, you are not actually acting on your opinion. If aborting a fetus is indeed Murder, why then are you not advocating the penalties we normally assign to killers? And to add insult to injury, the one who is really responsible gets off free, while we reserve whatever penalties to the &amp;quot;accessory&amp;quot; to the crime.  Dave   I bumped this post of mine, because I STILL don&apos;t see anyone advocating life in prison, or the death penalty for abortion.   If you DON&apos;T advocate it, then you really don&apos;t believe abortion is killing a human being.  Dave

But, I just wanted to say that I do believe abortion is killing a human child. Even in situations where it was a consequence of rape, or incest, it&apos;s still killing a human child. I don&apos;t however, believe that the choice should be taken away from women. I know that if I were raped and a child was the consequence of it, there&apos;s no way that I would want to carry around a daily reminder of such a vicious attack for 9 months. There&apos;s just no way to regulate this that would appease everyone that has an opinion about it, because then you get into gray areas, like, well what if it&apos;s going to harm the mother...or the baby has birth defects that are known early in the pregancy?....You can&apos;t just sit a woman down in an abortion clinic and ask prior to the procedure...&amp;quot;well, how did this happen? were you being irresponsible and end up knocked up? yes? ok, then you can&apos;t have an abortion.&amp;quot; Personally, I think that abortion is too easy an out for irresponsible behavior, I also don&apos;t think that the choice should be taken away.   Reason I responded to this quote is because I don&apos;t agree with the above statement about giving up some of what i have in support of the child...I&apos;m not the one that engaged in irresponsible behavior and ended up pregnant, so those that are against abortion should not be financially liable for a child just because of their beliefs. It&apos;s pretty easy to not get pregnant....don&apos;t have sex if you&apos;re not completely willing to accept the possible consequences of your actions.  One last thing, read a post a little while ago that said pregnancy may not show on a test until the 4-5 week mark. There are a lot of tests out there that will let you know you&apos;re pregnant before you even miss a period.

This might stop the downward spiral. Course getting drugs off the streets, and greed mentality would be helpful in the effort......

By the way, aunties are indeed a good deterent.    There was an unwritten law that if any parent caught a kid headed for trouble they could correct it on the spot and let the parents know, who in turn would correct them again when they got home....also if it was dinnertime and a child&apos;s family was known to be in trouble financially, wherever the child was at the time, he/she would be fed.

Therefore they should not be allowed to force their beliefs on others.  It&apos;s pretty easy to not  get pregnant   get arrested for DUI   get lung cancer   get mugged ....don&apos;t  have sex   drink alcohol   smoke cigarettes   leave your house  if you&apos;re not completely willing to accept the possible consequences of your actions.&quot;</u>  Where do get the idea that you can force anyone to do what you think they should do and then abdicate your responsibility for that decision?[/QUOTE]  I never said that abortion should be taken off the table as an option, so no, it&apos;s not my responsibility to provide the funds for that child&apos;s life. When I have children, planned or not, I will not expect anyone but myself and the father of my child to provide for that child. Hopefully, I&apos;ll be wise enough to not engage in a sexual relationship with someone that I don&apos;t believe will be there to face the consequences. If I&apos;m not, then I certainly wouldn&apos;t use abortion and the easy excuse &amp;quot;well he didn&apos;t stick around to help me&amp;quot; as a way to &amp;quot;abdicate&amp;quot; my own responsiblity. I don&apos;t agree with abortion when it&apos;s used as an out for someone that just doesn&apos;t want to take the responsibility for their actions. How are any of the things that you lined through comparable to a conscious decision with forseeable consequences? If anything you made my point for me, don&apos;t drink and drive, don&apos;t get a dui; don&apos;t smoke, don&apos;t get cancer. Don&apos;t have sex, don&apos;t get pregnant. Otherwise, be willing to accept the results. Personally and I&apos;m not attacking you, but the getting mugged thing and don&apos;t &amp;quot;leave your house&amp;quot; is creative, but ludicrous. Not comparable at all in my eyes.

So, if a woman gets her period on July 1st, has a 31 day cycle, (which can fluctuate for all sorts of reasons)conceives between the 15-19, on July 31st, she will be considered to be five weeks pregnant on the 31st. And knowing what you and I know, Bruce, it&apos;s a very valid example.

abortion_as_rights_or_choices	5531905206_6420099791001	82	lcplcross	Wed 01 October 2008 06:34 AM	I was born out of wedlock.  My birth mother had been raped repeatedly by three men.  Her good christian parents had her carry me around until I was no longer a part of her. She hated me, or perhaps she hated her parents, or maybe the circumstances. Children in the womb are aware.  I was.   I was adopted shortly after birth by two good christian parents who thought it best to beat the devil out of me whenever they thought I deserved it. In other words, I was abused.I wil spare you the details, but i have been in therapy for most of my adult life.  Suicide and I are closely aquainted.  If children are bearing children, then society owes both the education to make adult choices.  If women are bearing children to stay on welfare then they should be sterilized.  The problem is not the choices people make, especially when the reasons for those choices are not apparent to those who make them. Sex education should be mandatory, and should begin in grade school; by second grade.  Sex offenders should also be sterilized and segregated from society.  No second chances, and no parole.  If the burdon this places on society becomes too great, then they should all be killed as humanely as possibly.  The problems are harder to solve than the debate of cild or choice, but until all the underlying problems are identified and addressed, abortion is the only humane solution.

That is, if they even knew such a place even exsisted. The schools will NOT inform the sutdents about places they can go to for help with matters relating to contraception - they&apos;re forbidden to do so. The poor and uneducated still do not have good access to birth control and that&apos;s a fact. Also a fact is that many males, especially the younger ones, still refuse to take any responsibility for contraception on their own. Until they do, we&apos;ll always be having this argument. Sex is wonderful but men just have to accept that they WILL live to see another day if it doesn&apos;t happen that one time. All it takes is one time for 2 lives to be changed irrevocably. Think about it.  Who&apos;s the daddy? Most of the time, the fathers of the babies of underage girls are adult men. These men tend to make themselves invisable towards the end of the girl&apos;s pregnancy and refuse to contribute anything at all towards the support of their children. The appaling thing is that what we have going on here is a mass situation of statutory rape that&apos;s being totally ignored. If that law is going to be on the books then it should be enforced. 
abortion_as_rights_or_choices	5531905206_6420099791001	84	Whirled_Peas	Wed 12 November 2008 02:03 PM	I approach this issue myself from both a biological/medical perspective and a social/humanist perspective.  However, I do not ignore the religious perspective, which seems to be very important to many people on this issue.  I was talking with an acquaintance who gave me the Old Testament/Jewish perspective on when human life begins and abortion.  Here&apos;s what I got (copied/pasted with permission):    Anyway, there&apos;s that, for what it&apos;s worth.  The books of the Torah are, of course, the foundation for Jewish law and morality, and they&apos;re also the part of the Bible from which Christians get a lot of other morality-related issues.  It&apos;s clear from those books (for the religious perspective) that a fetus doesn&apos;t become a baby until it takes its first breath, and that abortion is not considered to be the killing of a human being.  Is this the unchanging word of God?

Indeed, the Old Testament would support that stance.

Equal protection and due process can get very tricky--the business law course I took in college drove me 3/4 nuts! There were no correct answers, only competing arguments; some more compelling than others, and some of those more compelling only because one advocate possessed greater skills of persuasion than another.   I love the idea that the Supreme Court doesn&apos;t come to decisions in a vacuum.  They hear arguments (which require context) from real live lawyers--again, some more skilled than others.  They ask questions (except for Clarence Thomas, of course) and often bait the solicitors away from their prepared texts and into territory those lawyers would rather not cover.  Few issues are as simple as black or white--the what-ifs are too numerous.

I am not ashamed or embarrassed by my beliefs, so I will continue to share them.    I don&apos;t know your political or moral leaning Tangler, but I have found, over the years, that most &amp;quot;liberals&amp;quot; simply refuse to accept that someone else can hold a viewpoint that might offend another.  They get so wrapped up in &amp;quot;tolerance&amp;quot; that they become intolerant of anyone they deem intolerant.  They tend to allow their emotions to override their logic, and they tend to make exaggerated statements such as the one you made.  I don&apos;t believe that all &amp;quot;liberals&amp;quot; fall into lockstep with Peter Singer or George Tiller, so I don&apos;t make those kind of exaggerated claims.   Christ stated clearly that the Gospel offends, and that Christians will be hated for His sake. So I don&apos;t expect much out of people these days.

Some things in this universe can and should be reduced to that simplicity.&quot;</u>   Ah, binary!  Now you are speaking my language!  One of the things we have discovered about using computers to define the real world is that binary is wholly inadequate.  This lead to the whole field of &amp;quot;fuzzy logic&amp;quot;, which essentially is programming in that gray space between 0 and 1.  Black and white are almost never the only choices.  In this case, the &amp;quot;humanity&amp;quot; of the prospective baby, as well as the &amp;quot;morality&amp;quot; of the abortion decision, are both on sliding scales.  As some have noted, there are at least instances of medical need under which abortion makes sense - this at least shows some part of the curve.  In my opinion on the case of abortion, there are two big questions, which must be addressed in order.  The first question is this: When does a couple of cells become a human being?  The churches say &amp;quot;at conception&amp;quot;, with which I argue both because of the lack of real criteria and because of the surprising number of fertilized eggs that do not make it.  At the other extreme are those who think the answer is &amp;quot;at birth&amp;quot; which is abhorrent in my opinion.  The answer must lie somewhere in between, but until we have established testable criteria we can never really agree on a point.  I would personally entertain the 2nd trimester - at the beginning I would not call it a human being, by the end I would say definitely it is.  In fuzzy logic, this would be a two-term output membership function - we would need to agree on the shape, perhaps trapezoidal but more likely sigmoid.  The second question is what factors should be considered in abortions - rape, poverty, health, convenience?  What is the societal cost of allowing/forbidding the abortion?  What is the moral cost?  All of these are to be considered, and none of them are black and white.  Again, to add my own 2 cents here, I feel that a significant number of abortions are making the best of a bad situation.  The output MF would look similar as the previous, but the big issue would be determining the input MF&apos;s.

No - because I accept that I must follow the laws of the country I live in, whether I like it or not.

Christian fundamentalists in my opinion have more in common with taliban extremists than not.   There is  no such thing as a pro lifer. These same pro lifers in my opinion champion the death penalty and are the biggest supporters of war and torture. They do not care about babies suffering in the Sudan. Why are they not outraged over babies dying around the world? After all being pro life they should care about life everywhere. God loves all people, everywhere. Fundies on the other hand only &amp;quot;care&amp;quot; about a fetus in this country.  Why are there so many babies/children without good homes? Why are not the NO Choice Fundies out there adopting unwanted children? Again it is because they do not care about children. They care about the &amp;quot;enslavement&amp;quot; of women.  There is no such thing as a pro lifer. If they believe abortion is murderthat means those doctors, mothers, families, friends, etc who participate in an abortion need to receive either the death penalty or life in prison. It is that simple.   As has been stated this has nothing to do with life/death. It is about men trying to control women through religion. Why are these fundies not out there adopting all those unwanted crack babies? Why are they outraged over &amp;quot;welfare mothers who keep having children when they ain&apos;t got no job.&amp;quot;  The term pro life needs to be changed to &amp;quot;No Choicer.&amp;quot; It is certainly more accurate than pro lifer. Abortion needs to be a safer option for those who want it. I do not like abortion, but letting old men decide what a woman can or cannot do with her body is BS. The Christian Taliban in this country needs to be put down just like its muslim cousin.  If you are in the military you are not pro life. Get over yourself. You are pro choice by the nature of the job. You, like everybody else just choose who/what u think should die or not.

They asked &amp;quot;if abortion were made illegal, what criminal penalty should the woman who gets the abortion recieve?&amp;quot; The answers were very interesting - most said abortion should be illegal, but the woman who gets the abortion should not receive any form of punishment. One did say the woman should possibly get a sentence of life imprisonment (she was anti-death penalty).   Anti-abortion protestors on punishing women who get abortions:   If abortion becomes illegal again, what punishment do you think the woman who gets an abortion receive?     A &amp;quot;parking ticket&amp;quot;-like misdemenor?   5 years in prison?    10 years in prison?    20 years in prison?    Life in prison?    The death penalty?  I&apos;m going to be hard-core about it: If abortion is murder under the civil law, then any woman who gets an abortion should get life in prison.

Would a monthly inquest be required for every sexually active woman who menstruates, in case a egg was fertilized and &amp;quot;lost&amp;quot;? Should women be required to be tested for pregnancy before purchasing Vitamin C, nigella, or other nutritional supplements that can end a pregnancy in very early stages? Since caffeine seems to be connected with miscarriages, should women be required to submit a recent negative pregnancy test result before being allowed to enter Starbucks? Should women even be allowed to work at Starbucks, seeing as that would allow easy access to caffeine? Also, certain massage techniques are used in folk medicine to assist with abortions- should women be restricted to shoulder and foot rubs until menopause?

So Abortionists would get the penalty.  Also, given that most abortion attempts by non-qualified personel tend to result in scarring, permanent injury, sterility or death.... do we really HAVE to worry about punishing the woman...  I think being rendered sterile is a pretty stiff sentence....  Much as I hate to say it.... better legal, safe and unnecessary, than the opposite.

So Abortionists would get the penalty.  Also, given that most abortion attempts by non-qualified personel tend to result in scarring, permanent injury, sterility or death...do we really HAVE to worry about punishing the woman...I think being rendered sterile is a pretty stiff sentence...

I can&apos;t get pregnant.&quot;</u> Assuming abortion is murder, under the civil and criminal law (for the purpose of the question, we are ignoring morals, and focusing strictly on civil and criminal law), saying that only the person who performs the abortion should be punished and not the woman who voluntarily has the procedure is like saying that, if a person shoots and kills another person with a pistol, only the gun manufacturer should be punished.  And what criminal punishment should be given to the father of the fetus, or the parents or family members of the woman/girl getting the abortion, who drive her to the doctor? If abortion is murder, under civil and criminal law, should they not be punished as &amp;quot;accessories before and after the fact&amp;quot;?  It is all very easy to say that &amp;quot;abortion is immoral and should be against the law&amp;quot; - but no law is worth anything more than a bucket of spit unless there is a civil or criminal punishment for breaking it. So why pass a law which doesn&apos;t penalize the person who breaks it - the woman who voluntarily gets the abortion?   If you don&apos;t want her to be punished, don&apos;t criminalize the procedure.

And, that just because a fetus does not speak and cannot protect itself, it is still a human life and should be afforded equal protection to other human life. So, lifeimprisonment or execution for abortion is logical from a pro-life standpoint, imho.  Further, if prolifers cannot stomach such stiff penalties for abortion, then why not? Dont they believe their own arguments?

If someone contracts out, and has their spouse killed, the same charge that would be brought against them should be the same for the mother if abortion was made illegal.

SO forget religion and look at the facts. Viability (life can be sustained utside the womb) of a fetus starts at like 6 or 7 months  in extreme cases with the odds improving with time. so at 6 months yes it is a human life. Scientificaly anytime before that, it is not a human, only what could have been one..thats why it is called a FETUS, not a baby. Most abortion providers DO NOT do abortions past week 20 to week 22. Now if we make abortion illegal, will that stop the problem? NO and we all know this, it will only push desperate females to dangerous lenghts. Putting MORE lifes in danger. At least right now they are preformed in a safe clinical enviroment by trained pros. thirdly, you will find &amp;quot;medical experts&amp;quot; on both sides of this fight so really they are not really valid to the argument.

One of the problems with defining a fetus as a life separate from that of the woman are the medical facts that not all fertilized eggs implant, not all implanted eggs survive to the point of viability, a woman may not be aware of her condition, and one cannot remove a fetus from a woman until it is viable, without ending or at least endangering its life. If a fetus is going to be granted all or even most of the rights that an infant would possess, you&apos;d find the state micromanaging the lives of women between the ages of 14 and 60.

I would really like to hear the answer&apos;s of the pro-life people on how a law against abortion should be punished and what this punishment will help in the matter of saving the unborn.   IMHO, abortion should be illegal, except from cases like rape, health issues, incest and such. Nevertheless, abortion should not be punished if performed after close monitoring and counseling and within the first 12 weeks of the pregnancy.   After all it is life, yes, but we do so much irresponsible stuff with this life (scientific) and yet we are trying to force women to carry out their pregnancy.   If men could get pregnant, the abortion issue would not be one. Also if men could get pregnant, they will have nothing but ONE child. After that, they would be &amp;quot;cured&amp;quot; and only have protected sex, no matter what...hmmmm...maybe that&apos;s not such a bad thought after all, but unfortunately it&apos;s impossible.

The 21-week-old unborn baby is named Samuel Alexander Armas, and is being operated on by a surgeon named Joseph Bruner. The baby was diagnosed with spina bifida and would not survive if removed from the mother&apos;s womb.  a C-section removes the uterus and the doctor makes a small incision to operate on the baby.  During the surgery on little Samuel, the little guy reached his tiny, but fully developed, hand through the incision and firmly grasped the surgeon&apos;s finger. The photograph captures this amazing event with perfect clarity.  Here is a picture of Samuel at 6 1/2.        Samuel is 9 years old today.

Wade is overturned it will be up to the states to determine if they will continue to allow abortions and it will be up to them to if the woman should be punished and how be she should be punished. Maybe probation for the first time will be an option.   Most certainly the abortionist, if they are breaking the state&apos;s law should be punished. Prison time, loss of license if they have one, heavy fines, confiscating of property.&quot;</u> Only the abortionist should go to prison?      Surely  the woman who voluntarily got the abortion is an accomplice to murder under the law  (if the laws on murder were expanded to include abortions). Why should she get probation?   If someone held you so you couldn&apos;t move while someone else shot you dead, would you want the shooter to be sent to prison and the one who assisted the shooter by holding you to make you a better target get probation or a slap on the wrist?   Face it, anti-abortion/pro-life people - if abortion is &amp;quot;murder&amp;quot; than the woman who voluntarily gets an abortion is a murderer - and needs to be criminally punished - not just the doctor who performs the medical procedure.   All the pictures of what goes on during some abortions and pictures of kids like little Samuel mean absolutely nothing in regard to the question I am presenting.  How should that child-murdering woman be punished?   For example, I posted this same original post on another Internet Forum and several posters suggested that the proper punishment for the woman would be irrevocable sterilization.    If you believe that abortion is murder, is sterilization an appropriate punishment for the woman who voluntarily gets an abortion  (assuming abortion becomes illegal)?

The American Prospect:   quote:  In a meeting with the editorial board of the  Des Moines Register  last year,  [Presidential candidate Mike]  Huckabee sidestepped answering the question directly but strongly suggested  he thinks at least certain types of birth control pills should made illegal.  In his Renewal Project speech Monday night, on the eve of the anniversary of  Roe v. Wade , Huckabee made yet another inappropriate and insulting comparison, maintaining that  overturning Roe is &amp;quot;not good enough,&amp;quot;  and that  letting the states &amp;quot;handle something that is a moral issue is the logic of the civil war.&amp;quot; &quot;</u> So, can I gather you would not be supporting Mike Huckabee for President? He advocates taking the ability to decide the legality of abortion and the criminal penalties for abortion away from the states and making a &amp;quot;one-size-fits-all&amp;quot; federal law on abortion and the criminal penalties.

Roe v Wade will not be overturned.Get over it. If you don&apos;t want an abortion, don&apos;t get one. If you do,you don&apos;t have to answer to anyone but yourself and your God, if you believe in such things.&quot;</u>   It is the kind of question that will start having to get asked as soon as the current lineup of the Supremes gets the next abortion case and overturns Roe and sends it back to the states. Based on all previous writings, the five Catholics on the present Court are only delaying the inevitable to keep it a live issue in the 2008 election, but Roe is for all intents and purposes a dead letter. Elections have consequences. If you are concerned about what those consequences would be for you personally, contact your state legislatures, because that is where this sort of decision is going to get made.
